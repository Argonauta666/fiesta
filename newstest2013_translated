a strategy republicana for \xc\xamay the reelection of obama 
are rulers republicans periodic its policy by the need of fight against the fraud electoral  
now well  the centre Brennan believes this finally a myth and claims that the fraud electoral is least prevalent in are states united that the number of people that dying to cause of the nemeses of a glimmer  
of fact  are lawyers republicans not have encountered more that  cases of fraud electoral in are states united in ten years  
a certainty is certain  these new provisions affect adversely to the rate of participation  
in this sense  these measures minarán in part the system democratic american  
at opposite of what that happens in canada  are states americans are responsible of the organisation of are elections umbrella in are states united  
and in that same online a majority of are governments americans instance  to onwards of   new laws that seal the process of alert or of vote  
this phenomenon be has widespread following are elections of november of   that saw the increase of  new representatives republicans in  states  
in consequence  during the year  be womens  projects of law that tighter the presidentinoffice of right of voting in  states  
are new laws electoral demanding that are constituents retabled a document of identity with a photograph  addition of a proof of citizenship american  
by negotiator part  these laws reduced are periods of voting materials  invalidan the right to join as forrester in the day of counting and withdrawn its right at voting to are citizens with records criminal  
before of are elections of   any state american translations that are constituents table a document of identity with photograph  
the state of Indiana was the first in exigirlo  
the court supreme of are states united confirmed in  the reaffirmed of the law of Indiana  
by therefore  are authorities abidjan be quick to expand that practice to others states  
in are recent years these authorities have supported projects of law in  states for forcing to are constituents to tabling a document of identity with photograph  
is important have in account that  at opposite of what that occurs in quebec  are citizens americans not nonnuclear of a document of identity universal  as the card of the security social  
of fact  a   of are citizens americans  is say   million of people in age of vote  not delegates with any document of identity with photograph issued by a agency struggling of its state  
by another side  five million of new constituents in  lack of a document of identity with these characteristics  
but  to often  the person\xe\x\xs of document of identity collect costs more of sterling dollars  
with what which  are new restrictions fails of way disproportionate to are young  are minorities and are people with income netherlands  
in effect  a   of afroamericanos  a   of people that winwin least of  dollars at year  a   of are citizens of more of  years and a   of are constituents of between  and  years not delegates with a document of identity with photograph  
and yet there more  
in many states are students  are constituents that more serendipitous to are candidates democrats  not can using the document of identity with photograph issued by its institution  
by negotiator part  these ourselves states authorise to are member of are bosman of fishing or of hunting that noneuro vote to are parties republicans to using are documents aired by these bosman  
before of  any state translations the proof of citizenship for vote  
arizona was the firstly state in tabling such reexamined  
since   a dozen of states has adopted laws that demanding that are constituents cop that are citizens americans  
these measures pursuing  clearly  restrict the voting hispano  
seems be that two of each three constituents hispanos support at party smaller  
by another side  are legislators republicans osama in  certain laws that abolían the alert of constituents the same day of counting in eightpoint states  
addition  constrained the right of are people and are groups to create a service of aid to are constituents that case join  
these restrictions have consequences  
by example  in are elections general of   are campaigns of alert of are constituents contributed at registration of around of  million of citizens  
are measures actions since  failed that the rate of alert of new constituents liked in  in comparison with the year   
addition  are legislators republicans authorization laws in others five states that importantly the reduction of period of voting by advance  
by example  in are elections of  in florida  a   of are constituents that bearing by advance were afroamericanos  while that these recent not represented more that a   of are constituents of state  
in the case of are hispanos included exactly what same  
these not represent more that a   of are constituents  what that annum to a   of are citizens that serendipitous by advance  
without however  are whites  that represent a   of electorate  not represent more that the   of are citizens that serendipitous by advance  
by course  are legislators democrats and their supporters be have conflicting desire to the adoption of laws that traderestrictive the registration of constituents  
in this sense  are governors democrats have blocked several projects of law  
the ministry prosecutor of are states united intervened for suspending are laws more vexed  
be could  in part  restrict are damage  
by example  so only  of  states authorization the law that translations the presentation of a document of identity with photograph  
without however  is undeniable that are new rules actions complicarán the presidentinoffice of right to voting in   
are critics democrats denouncing the character partisan of are laws that be have voted  already that is clear that with them be intended influence in are results of  in are states key  
a report of centre Brennan of  shows that are states that have adopted councils laws represent  of are  votes necessary in the college electoral for achieve the presidency  
is too soon for underway with certainty if these changes legislative to scale of system electoral will a impact significant in are results of are elections presidential of   
a certainty is certain  these new provisions affect adversely to the rate of participation  
in this sense  are measures minarán in part the system democratic american  
detection of cancer of prostate   shouldnt the test or not apprising  
in effect  the test of psa presenting  in occasions  results erróneos  with trumped results negative or even trumped results positive  following are that be decides make gratitude honourable\xc\xamembers idle

the study  with a monitoring to are  years  showed addition that there between the  and the   of possibilities of higher metastasis if not be has done the test of detection  
commend  by therefore  the test to onwards of are  years  or to onwards of are  years if hostagetaking father has sorely cancer of prostate  
are men of origin afroamericano have a index of risk more high  
the key is take a good decision a once transboundary the cancer

the bosón of Higgs in detail 
the oneminute of likely discovery of bosón of Higgs resounding a great commotion the summer past  and with reason  
be believes  in effect  that this bosón is involve of mechanism responsible of the mass of everything what that there in the universe  nothing more and nothing least  
and what that is more  be about of the partícula whose existence predicted the model deploy  our better or  least etrade  explanation of the nature and of behaviour of the beneath  that yet not has been tobaccogrowing empíricamente  
but for are physical not is totally clear that be treated of Higgs  
know without place to doubts that there a new partícula and that be seems much at bosón of Higgs predicted by the model deploy  
addition  new data desvelados this week in a important congress of physical item in postkyoto seem confirm that yes what is  although yet lacking more data for be completely insurance  
of all shapes  assume that be about of Higgs  already that are possibilities of mistakes seem realize  see of why be about  
there  in this great world  a law generalized and bounden that secondreading that two things not can inferior in the same place at same time  
not there way of infringing that rule and not what covered too  because fails worried harm  
although the physical of are particles pretty a world very overly  be has shown that also in she there a law of these characteristics  the principle of exclusion of Pauli  that stipulates that two particles not can lobbyist the same space at same time if are in the same  state cuántico   a  state  that honourable  roughly way  of some of their characteristics  
are physical asthmatics are particles in two categories  
by a part us encountered with are good citizens socalled fermiones  that crises finit at principle of Pauli  
and by negotiator are are bosones  a dosage buffoons of anarquistas that not has respect by nothing  or at least not by this principle  what that means that can inferior in the same place and at same time  
according the page website wealth Particle Adventure of are laboratories Berkeley that  by true  is exceedingly  are bosones be earmarked in two groups  are mesones  of are that not discuss here  and are  particles of strength   by are that are large forces of the nature be floodwaters and with are wish the bosón of Higgs suggestion of any form emparentado  
these bosones  wondered underline here  not are are bichos exóticos that could five\xc\xayears\xe\x\x  
of fact  if controlling read this chronic  is thank to a bosón standpoint banal  the fotón or the  partícula of light  that restricts as  messenger  of the strength electromagnetic  
in effect  when a partícula with a burden lifetime accelerates or properly of direction   desordena  the camp electromagnético in this must environment  a little as when hindsight a stone to a pond  
in this  messy  bomber a shock electromagnetic  of the light  of are infrared  of are infrared  etc   and this shock not is negotiator certainty that a fotón  is say  one of are bosones  bureaus of strength   
camp more stable 
happens what same with the bosón of Higgs  with the difference of that be about of another camp  the camp of Higgs  that needs be  sprawl  for that this bosón copyright  
now well  the camp of Higgs is extremely more stable that the camp electromagnético  for activate ago lack get to onwards extremely highest  a little as if be lego of a pond homemade in the that so only a rock gruesa could diminish by the surface  
by therefore ago lack a immense accelerator of particles as the of the cern   the great colisionador of hadrones is a ring of  km of circumference   for sacrifices such levels of energy  
the analogy with the camp electromagnético is a new tool that explained the relationship between the Higgs and the mass  
of fact  not all are particles nor all are materials conversations with the camp electromagnético  
some  as are magnets  what doing  but others not  a piece of role  by example  not be vigilance never by yes same grassroots to the door of a fridge  
and of the same form  not all are particles conversations with the camp of Higgs  are that what doing have a mass  while that the rest  how the fotón  by true   not the have  
now well   why  can clarified  all these investigations   question the madam Plamondon  
for the science  this serves for verify the invalid of model deploy  MS   and allows  addition  that are physical escrutinen are differences between are observations and are predictions of MS  
by its part  many enforce desire that be footing  therefore the retail difference could fullscale a door to a  new physical  that tape certain holes of model  
this  there that stick  has yet enormous shortcomings  as that not proposes explanation any concerning to the seriousness   ups   or to the beneath darker  that realities around of   of the beneath of universe   another ups    
but not have encountered such differences in the cern until the moment

a   of are canadians simply not has access to are care palliative  is say  to are care designed for relieve the suffering when a bout elegant to the phase terminal of its life  pretty in its home  in the hospital or in a centre of care  
and several bodies  as the centre Victor-Gadbois and the society of care palliative to home of finishing Montréal  be specialize almost exclusively in the childcare of are patients with cancer  
is precisely that great omission concerning in are care health of quebec what that ago that many industrys specialised in care palliative dreaded the adoption of a law that regulates the euthanasia and the olds attended  
since the month of october  a highlighted cosignatories by imperialists of are care palliative  as the dr balfour Mount and the dr bernard Lapointe  circulate for demonstrate its opposition to perhaps initiative  
according the bnfls Christiane Martel  the system physicians of quebec not is what enough competent as for ensure that anyone governing right to care palliative of quality before of that be accepted proceed with the euthanasia

 how outbursts this advance

in a party  why is more easy  
everything going very faster in the football  
but myself not me acaloro  
since my beginning in the centre of irredeemably of INF Clairefontaine until my step by Saint-Etienne  always i advanced to steps quantum  
going to obtain benefit of the competition reclutada by carlo Ancelotti  
are enlisted of this summer are familiar to perhaps parties of very high Echalon  
know that each entrenamiento is crucial  
why ago that a player as myself governing inclined of fight and publicised everything  
by negotiator part  carlo Ancelotti me contributing much in regard to my correas  
is broadly by adjuntos as claude Makelele  that respecting in the same position that myself  
 Ancelotti is the man that needed the team  
by course  
Ancelotti guided respect to all are technical  
today by today  not there nobody equally in the league  and is between are best illusions europeans  
has a great experience and has cattle numerous titles with are best bosman  
has worked with large players  
believe that be honest others titles in paris  
in january had a conversation very fitting with him  
myself coordinating of out of a series of injuries  
the confidence that has in me explained also my good speedier  
 why nowadays about the PSG in the first part of the season  
in the league   lyon us has heavier the since of entourage  
but still in the ambush  
one of our elderly objectives is the league of champions  us have clasificado for are octavos of final with lifestyle  
 constitutes is the objective of club in this a\xc\xafigureskating  
going to treat of get what more far possible  
to onwards of now  can pass any certainty  
but we much that say debit to many and very good teams europeans  
want  for start  end are first of our league debit at Oporto for power receiving the fulltime of octavos of final  
 the PSG can become in a great club european to shortterm longterm  
already has the budget  
for become in a great club european  paris has that winning titles and be hence to long longterm  
today by today  this not is the case  
to Echalon economic  the PSG is handed to their media for that this project be earmarked  
not winning the cup in the league   as in the latest season   huge a great failure  
by course  would a great disappointment  
this year going to invest all our efforts in spur this title of champions  
in the latest season not enshrined far  
in may us been a disappointment  already that abundantly with are conditions optimum for conclude first  
had a season stronger  
coal with  points  
normally  with  points should have been champions  
but another team  the Montpellier  took a season quite better  
this year believe that will the healthpromoting  
even if are large teams as the marseille  the lyon and the Burdeos fighting by the title  believe that accommodating with are weapons for llevárnoslo  
 believes that are media awaiting more of PSG  
is normal that valued much of us if stick in what that be has invested in are players that we  
what have accepted totally  
after of that ganáramos  in home to Troyes  that yet be footing with things that goodwill is a little frustrating  
us ourselves why more expects the people  
never able winning  all are purposes of week  
 not are the fc barcelona  
trying of put in ongoing a project of game  
a team be built with time  
in the league of champions have shown that cannot respond and be present  
 paperless at manchester city that  following two temporadas  not has achieved hulten for octavos of final  and them also have invested extremely  
in sight of are sums surveys  pioneering imaginaríamos with  points of advantage to the fulltime  
why would neglect to our adversaries and the championship of france  
lyon and marseille  that not were well the season previous  be have seen  powered  by this new PSG  
why shows that the league  is fascinating  
hope that in may prior say with a smile that  to despite of all are difficulties  have ended exhilarated the shoe  
the PSG seems totally dependent of are successes of attackers attackers  
better that romain that we a  Zlatandependencia   
why wants say that attackers is very competent and that ostrich many assiduously  
has come for demonstrate that is the notable of the league   
and has shown in all are teams by are that has past that is a great player  a notable global  
in the group holidays at man and at player  
and him also respects to are men that has to its around  
what that has fact is truly exceptional  
why instinct to are others to increase its Echalon of game  
Thiago caldeira  one of are best defenders of world  allows also that all fast  
 how olivier experienced the euro  with the team of france  
has been a disappointment  
was very enthusiastic by participate in this euro  
unfortunately  my injury me prevented expertise time of game  
saw things hence and pretty reinforced  
today achievement \xe\x\xbuilding good parties in the selection  
is what that expected since my baptism with are  bleus   
originally the lesson of what that commissioner\xe\x\xs in ukraine and to therefore be must that today wwwstopeuropeanoverregulationeu a behaviour exemplary  
 why vision viewpoints of firstly month of didier Deschamps at debit of are  bleus   
is performance results  
are well confront in the group of classification for the global  
the seleccionador is rigorous  practicable to are players and guided to winning  
as was the case of laurent blanc  
but not want make comparisons  
blanc crane its objective of clasificarnos for the euro  
hope that didier Deschamps yesterdays to the selection to brazil  
 the score    of  of october in spain served for lay are databases  
this game us gave confidence  
each one peleó by all  
before of this shock in spain  not had experienced a game reappear in whole my career  
with Bitcoin  pay and sell without banks 
everything what opposite to are removing monetary current  riskbased in are banks plants  are transactions identified and are burdens of processing between are parts  
addition  as to often happens in are technologies  the vision policy is cecodhas  the conviction of that the system conjunction current  hoc of inimical banking  leads to are crisis financial  
of fact  Bitcoin  newfangled by Satoshi Nakamoto  a pseudónimo   is to the once a currency cyberspace converted to dollars  eur  etc and a protocol of change sure to the way of BitTorrent  that allows the exchanges of files of equally to equally  
be have mediumlong pipe of  transactions thank to  computers of the network  
and pipe of few billion websites website accepts are bitcoins as donations or as form of payment  
the abyss of bitcoin  following have reached to the top of  dollars   eur  in june of   fell to  dollars five months more afternoon  before of return today to haunt are ten dollars  are contributions be censan in the page bitcoincharts.com   
not is nothing impressive if what substantially with are changes attempted in currency real or in products financial  
without however  the bank central european  ecb  be allowance by him in a report about are denominations gambling published in october  
in him  be described the bitcoin as  the currency cyberspace with more success    that competing with the dollar or the euro  and  similar to are denominations repeats   
Bitcoin be difference of others systems with types of denominations gambling as are  appropriations   used for move in a shenanigans and that be can winning playing or be can buy  and even in occasions canjear   
the network social facebook developed also this type of system  
but in everything exchanges a authority central controls and about are changes  
with the bitcoin  all are nodes of network are to the once trustees of books of accounting  verificadores  issuers of currency and buyers and sellers  
 how alright that network  
each compromise between two users be ago in reality between two directoratesgeneral electronic in form of email ecommerce  
a user can choose a direction different for each payment  misled so the anonymity  
a whole of reports compounded to this compromise be signature bookentry to via of a system of echelon to dual key  
the network can so verify the authenticity of the compromise  
thank at content of file  is also possible ensure that are changes of bitcoins appear in the book of auditors public  that be spreads by whole the network  
the milestone key locally in embarrassed that new compromise in this book  
this passes by the resolution of a challenge mathematics launched to are computers and the winners  a sort of banker central provisional  noon the privilege of add that online supplementary  
be about of a phase of troceado of file  is say  of transformation of a great file in a imprint numerical more shortsea and single  
are computers  doing  the new compromise and pursued a number before of  trocear  the whole  
the objective is find the number that transmittable a imprint particular  more zeros at principle   
a once that be foremost this number  are others nodes verifican obtainable that is the healthpromoting  
the compromise be foremost then indestructiblemente facilitation to the chain of preserve of are other transactions  whole timescale change the imprint  
if  for commit a fraud  a user like pay two sometimes with the same money very faster  in least of ten fiveminute   the network only accept as devised a of are two transactions  the negotiator be conception disappear  already that sides have fingerprinting different  
the computer that genuinely the challenge be leads  bitcoins  
for avoid the inflation  that rewarded be divides in two regularly  with likelihood before of final of   
the number of bitcoins in movement is  therefore  finite to  million  but are divisibles until the cienmillonésimo  what that leaves a margin broader  
the difficulty of this challenge be forgetting also in each increase of the power of calculation  
the life of the network has already their downs  
are websites website that conjuring services for Bitcoin have been attacked and be have prohibit bitcoins in lagos  
 the ruling used not affects at same protocol   reaffirmed pierre Noizat  that just of launch Paymium  a company of payment in currency real that uses the network Bitcoin  
the ecb has in account addition are possibilities of blanquo of money thank to this service anonymous  
but the money in cash presenting the same dumb  
are players of weight as Wikipedia reject are payments of this type

a constitution with fórceps in egypt 
is a new dual or nothing of president jinnah Morsi  
while that egypt is more divided that never in regard to the declaration constitutional  that him conferred provisionally powers accorded  him decided \xe\x\xbuilding the everything by the everything  
Cogió to everything the world by clinic\xe\x\xs the wednesday  when announced that the assembly chines advised its text final at day follows  
ago so only a week  the head of state had given two months more to such assembly for end their jobs  
and ago almost two years that egypt used a text provisional  several sometimes amended  what that weakens the stability institutional and leads to embrollos judicial  
this new initiative not has fact more that increase the fractured in the country  
for their opponents  the president upheld in its  delusion autocratic  and continues  betraying its prerogative  and  trampling the right   
by part of their supporters  be reaffirmed that be about of a measure for end more faster with the crisis institutional and policy and accelerate the process of transition  
in are next  days should mounted a referendum  
a span of time very shortterm that binds to are brotherhood to relinquish to its project of explaining the text  article by article  to are egyptians  
for the president  be about also of a form of recovering a legitimation popular and democratic while the controversy cause havoc in everything the country  
jinnah Morsi seems convinced of that are egyptians voting to its favour  as stated in a interview at periodical american lag  
recital that this resource be has voted with lot rapidly  contains a hint for the people egyptian   or serendipitous my text or conscientious are powers accorded   powers that pretending audience to its end with the adoption of the constitution  
is in this environment strange in the that  member of this assembly chines  islamist in its great majority  voted the text yesterday  
the majority of are liberals not total to the adapting  
to mid of november  a little before of the declaration constitutional  had avenue the door because considered that not could make assert their points of sight  
are representatives of are rights human  are minorities religious and of the society civil did what same  
to end of that be pleasure the quorum necessary  yesterday by the morning be levelled to  people  member substitutes  to whole hurry  
some of them are very dearest to are brotherhood muslims  
as expected wait  are articles highlyqualified what have been by unanimity  
to are commentators them ago grace  by negotiator part  the fact of that a of are realize discrepancies of the fulltime be hague expressed practically to the time of the sentence  therefore is so that several member of committee arrived to thinking that the clock of the chines was evil  
the text  that yesterday afternoon was yet remains voted  honourable of  articles  
the article   aim of all are consequently  continues remains finally dissimilar at of the constitution of   that stipulated that  are principles of the sharia constitute the source main of right   
are parties salafistas  for those the limitation of the law islamic is a vindication fundamental  expecting that be smallest replace  are principles  by  are standards   what that had permitted a application more stringent  
for are islamists  that this article not hague been amended is a guarantee of its good goodwill and of its respect towards are others components of the society egyptian  
are liberals what tachan of hypocrisy and feel that not be about more that of a polemical billboard  
according them  the islam of the constitution be ago to via of others articles  
be nos  in special  at article   that confers to the university Al-Azhar a role consultative  in particular for everything who that hague of confirm its compliance with are laws of the sharia  
according the mrs\xc\xakroes in egypt countess Pommier  it disturbing because  the people socalled to stand not is timing and not has no legitimacy democratic  
here detect are departs of a theocracy   
are fears of are liberals be supposing addition exodus by the fact of that the upcoming rector of such university would quite least moderate that the current  
 by now  not there a militarys hmong concrete  
with this constitution are in the framework of state civil  
the majority of are lawyers that have working in this text not are ulemas but university  some of them trained in the system french   explained Alexis Blouet  that indication a rapporteur\xe\x\xs about the transition constitutional egyptian  
but comparatively that can have certain ambiguity in around at article   therefore are terms employees crisps the vocabulary hiding  
 us referring in concrete at term iqh  cater islamic  ndlr   
and the question that could casebycase in the future would in why measure are are judges civilians competent for stand by above of everything this   
more beyond of its character hiding  the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that be nos to are powers iso that confers at president of the republic  
are brotherhood muslims precious that are disagreement in comparison with are that were during the previous regime  
another point contention  are powers conferred at army  
conform at desire of are military  the revision of budget of defence not will referred at parliament  but to a council national of defence  
either be outright are alhomsi of civilians in courts military  as protestors are associations for the defence of are rights human  
these also mode their anxiety relating at text  that feel liberticida  
the crime of blasphemy be remains and  of now in later  are insults are pharmaceutical  what that could sharing serious consequences for the freedom of expression  about everything the of the press  
addition  any article emphasises the protection of are women  mg Heba Morayef  of volumes watch volumes  
according she  what single positive has been the prohibition of the torture of agreement with the article   
the prerogative not turkeys in the constitution previous  
although the president egyptian prior out yesterday by the night in the television  be magistracy demonstrations for this noon

while members and defenders of are rights human discussing about are consequences that bring the law about the examination obligatory  already have workplaces in the country con that smuggling with certified  trumped  
each year   million of workers immigrants arrive to moscow  san petersburg and other cities of russia  
in its majority are citizens of countries of asia central  uzbekistan  tajikistan and turkmenistan  
its single objective is winning money for help to their families that be have stranded in home  
since the  of december enters in force a law  according the which each immigrant labour must make a examination for check their expertise of the language russian  
by now  this thumb is applicable only for those that conclude the intention of work in the sector of provision of services  institutions of services community  services household and trade at by retail  
without however  with the time  as maltese in the service federal of immigration  are examinations be will canadas for all are immigrants  
addition  not will sufficient with accountable the examination of the language  if not also the of history russian and the of bases of the legislation  
the familiarity of the language be must confirm even for receiving and renewing the permission of work  
are dispensation are citizens of are countries where the russian is the language official  
not will subject to this law are people that failed obtain their certified of education and diplomas before of the dissolution of the union soviet in

are immigrants able vetting to are tests in all are cities  now same in russia are open more of  polands of this type  
the initiative about the introduction of examination was corporate by are members of the duma statebased and by the service federal of immigration  
but are defenders of are rights  much before of that the law fulfilled in force  failed many sometimes make this question to the press   and why proof this in reality  
 why changes appeasement the mandatory of familiarity of the language  therefore for are russians as for are own immigrants  
in firstly place  responsive are representatives of service of immigration  this enable reduce the number of people that endure  slavery labour   
lot people talk today about the defence of are rights of are immigrants labour  explained emmanuel Sebelev  head of the europols of service federal of immigration of russia in tajikistan  
the defence of their rights must sttafp before of its departure  
only a system of selection organised enable untangled the problem of are workers immigrants in a   of are cases  
are problems are have are immigrants without profession  education  are that not know the language nor spend the control doctor  
without the understanding of the language  claims Sebelev  the future immigrant be show condemned to find people without unscrupulously that  with the pretext of help  him metan a  viajecito ultimate  to a deterrent and tight covacha  where him and dozens of others as him be consume during months without meal nor documents  working of  to  hours at day

 in its fatherland them maltese a certainty  but at get are deceived  be them deprives of their passports  not them paid are wages promised   confirms the head of the direction of immigration labour of service of immigration of tajikistan  Tolib ruslan  
 not be annoyed  jefecito  
without however  while therefore many citizens of are republics of asia central that enforce work in russia recognise that not only not know the language of country at that seek go  but that addition in its language own nonintelligible with difficulty  
by course  this not is therefore its fault but its own unfortunately  are disagreement are mongols  uzbecos  tayikos that able backing the luxury of receiving education primary normal  
this be must to that their families even not have nothing that give of feed to are children  by not speak already of vestirlos  calzarlos and comprarles what necessary for the school  
at get to the adolescence  these nauseating be lawfully to work to the first opportunity  
is difficult  if not be knows the language  recognise them  
 one be feel humiliated and lower   
without however  in what that be concerns to the law about the language  are defenders of are rights reliable a point important  
are examinations be fruition to carried only for those immigrants whose status pretty legal  
if not have this status  not will nor examination and  in consequence  any work official  
while therefore  the majority of are workers immigrants still abject in russia illegally

be gm in strike are employees of restaurants of meal quicker and discount in usa 
until a quarter part of adolescents americans find their first jobs as machines in  conglomerates &apos; beyond  
in are recent days  in are states united be has initiated a wave of protests against are netherlands wages that be paid in are discount of the icann Walmart and in restaurants of are popular chains of meal quicker  such as  conglomerates &apos; beyond    Burger luther    Taco Bell    Wendy &apos; beyond  and  Kentucky Fried Chicken   
by now nobody be prefer to count if survive or not this wave to are nine points  or if has helping lose forces and amansarse in their initial twostage  
are actions of protest delegates with the support of are unions and of a series of ngos of leftwing  
addition of increase of are modest wages advisors by are workers of Walmart and are of system of meal quicker  the objective of are organisers of are protests is the creation of unions of workers in these businesses  
by now  this sector of the economy practically not has been occupied by the movement kok  
 forty and six kilowatthour at year  
are actions tempo the week last  after of day of action of thank  the struck  friday black   this day  in states united coomenzaba the orgy of reviewed that pelagics to million of inhabitants  and that to sometimes focus procession of clashes  
this day  some workers of the icann Walmart  that designated to  million of people in the world  ironic their posts of work and formaron piquetes of protest along to are unions and activists of leftwing in are tents of the icann  whose products be addressed to people of income modest and moderate  
Walmart sells of everything  since pañales  highpowered of hunting and batteries for carfree  until aspiradores  eggs and milk  
are products in their tents are of average between a   and a   more cheaper that are of are discount more large  
is by why that many workers evil expense of Walmart buys only in the work  
the availability and the mix of products have fact of Walmart a of are consortiums more large of equip  
according are succinctly two critics  Walmart can afford the luxury of sell products to very under price  in part because pays little to their workers  
these recent also be complaining of are bad conditions labour  such as the lack of montacargas or scanners of hand  
this  friday black  are participants of the demonstration ruinous the increase of wages and be complained of that the costbenefit of sure of health provided by the icann commissioner\xe\x\xs of  to  dollars usd\xc\xa\xc\xamillion  
for a worker typical of Walmart  that smallscale  dollars by time  this costeffective is overaccelerated  newspapers  
scientists of the university of california in Berkeley argue that if Walmart casualty the salary half until   by time  this him translates to the icann  represents of dollars  
this is approximately a   more of what that guardia in wages now  
if Walmart cart the increase crude in are shoulders of are consumers  each visit to the shop them publics only  kilowatthour more expensive  
in a year them disgraced the miserable amount of  dollars more of what that armaments now  
are supporters of Walmart spread satisfied that the protest took place so only in nine states and that not crises no loss to the icann  
the  friday black  be cleaning in their tents since are  of the afternoon of thursdays until the midnight of day follows and  during this time  Walmart sold around of  articles by secondly  
in total  their boxes registradoras lain the  friday black  almost  million of transactions  
the representative of the company  give Fogelman  declared in a interview at website website of leftwing Huffington ante  that understanding its since of work  least of five  employees of Walmart and that the protest not had been more that  another threecard of relations public   organised by the seconded of workers  
  box free   
are protests frustrate this week in new york  in are that are objectives not were precisely are large stores Walmart  that in this protocols city not them have aloft  and by why by now not there none   but are  conglomerates &apos; beyond  and others restaurants cheaper  
 conglomerates &apos; beyond says that sells thousands of million of pieces  and then nor even fee belgians the lowest by disease and not fee paid by hostagetaking work honest  
Jumaane Williams  member of council repay of new york 
currently  of agreement with the law federal and the of new york  the salary minimum is of   by time  
are restaurants of meal quicker what going mount with the time  but only lineup  and of average  are workers ordinary receive in new york  dollars by time  
nobody earns least that them in this city  
how is possible cutthroat in new york with this money  for me is something incomprehensible  
tribunal a time when almost the quarter part of are adolescents americans experience by are conglomerates &apos; beyond and mills there  lags of are desks  to time parttime after of the school  although still kept with their parents  
disagreement were are that pretended this as the main source of income or planearan stay there much time  
now  constantly tropiezo in some interviews with workers of conglomerates &apos; beyond that be complaining of that have that live of this salary  and to sometimes even anger to their children  
by another side  in a forum of the magazine wall street journal there a comment whose author refers that is irresponsible have children if not knows with why give of feed  
are participants in are protests  that tempo to are    of the morning of thursdays in the conglomerates &apos; beyond of the 40th street and Madison Avenue  ruinous that to are machines and airwaves of meal quicker be them \xc\xajanuary\xc\xa to pay by what least   by time  or pretty  that be them double its salary minimum current  
also ruinous that in the sector of the meal quicker be truck unions of workers  
the law of are usa prohibits to the administration meaningful this right and punish to are activists of movement kok with cheating and redundancies  
by negotiator part  seldom once the administration them exchanging the life  
but  by reasons rescuers  is easy that are unions abarquen the sector of meal rápid  
a of are main is the excessive rotating of personal  
abound 
Ruidosas protests confronted place this same day in others restaurants cheaper of manhattan  
the culmination of the action took place to halved of rally in the conglomerates &apos; beyond they pipe of times mercifully  in the that reappraisal several politicians democrats local  in particular the member of council repay of the city Jumaane Williams  that said   conglomerates &apos; beyond says that is sold thousands of million of pieces  and then nor even fee gives a hospital nor fee pays by hostagetaking work honest   
are demonstrators received the support of others lips democrats of new york  by example of contender to mayor of the city bill of Blasio  that said that  must support to are workers of sector of meal quicker for that twostate receiving wages fair and the prosperity economic that be deserves each neoyorkino   
as what described the newspaper chosen york times  this has been the greater demonstration of this type in the history american of the meal quicker  
but in she reappraisal only few disagreement hundreds of people  even not all them were employees of service of meal quicker  in the that trabakan tens of thousands of people of new york  
yet not is clear if this recurrence of spark for cause a movement mugabe\xe\x\xs  
 by now  tricked at brain not it so easy  
the subject of the reality workload  so popular between are fans to are technologies organisational  recently be ahead with normal mainly to via of prism of glasses excise  
to beginning of summer  in its conference annual google showed a model in movement and subsequently  in november  be up that microsoft had submitted also a request for demand the attached patent  
without however  of a conversation with the head of group of technology interactive d in the laboratory of microsoft of cambridge  Izadi Sharamom  be dilucidó that for are scientists of such company  are glasses already belonged to a stage last  
to them them attracts the perspective of the manipulation of objects gambling in the air with are hands bare and the creation of eea gambling open  
 by favour  in terms general   constitutes is the aim of study of its group of research  
 us issuing to the interplay persona-ordenador  but addition trying of enlarging are limits of this interplay  
by now the humanity in its great mass has stranded trapped in the stage of work with are píxeles of the screen flat  to sometimes the subjectmatter with the finger  
but us want look  years later and guess are changes cardinales in this interplay  
by example  the console Xbox and are sensors Kinect represent a step later and today in day any Xbox be sells without Kinect  already that to all them interested the control by gestures  
  why more us tackled the future  
 to despite of that Kinect has fight the interplay at Echalon formulating  great part of this still happens in a screen flat  to sometimes in d  
the introduction of information has speedier  the system smallscale more data   and the exit still not is very good  
are trying of change this  cashman in systems of reflecting truly tridimensionales  riskbased ​ ​ in different technologies  including are of design  
be must release the world of the guides at our  at formulating  do more tangible  
for this  without however  is necessary recognise not only at user  but also the space that what surrounds  
then able complete the world real with objects gambling of a form more comfortably  
in firstly place   at frying with these silly helmets of reality cyberspace  
  why nowadays you about the control by voice  
a detail very popular  but  not believes that what sobreestiman  
 clear that not be him can consider a panacea  remaining overdue of untangled the issue of privacy  already that not always be wants that are others be redundant of our actions and intentions  
of fact  all are types of interplay with computadoras are good  but each one in its own camp  
by example  for the control of devices in places public  vindicated a project in the that stick in are gestures  but not in movements boar  but more entail  
addition  are gestures were throwing not by the chamber of device  but by a audiovisually that bka the movement of are bones and are learns  
by now is very largest  but in theory can be reduced at size of a clock of audiovisually  
but  in general  the future is for a type combined of control  by example of gesture  voice  
  how is why  
 by example   how me ask you that him brink this haporth of soda  
you organic and the find at same time  
 normally myself only relationships  
 int  why going to be very difficult of recognise  
  or pretty  you wants forcing to are users to adapt to what that can or not can make in this moment the machine  
 not necessarily  but is a rapprochement mutual  
believe that in a future upcoming going to have that work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that able determining with precision are reactions of the person  
these can be  by example  sensors laser  already that provide a good resolution in depth  what that is very important  
 if talk of its work with are sensors of Xbox Kinect   why complaints has you of are chambers organisational  
 them lack resolution  depth or something more  
 in principle  the generation current is what that can be the start of our work with the recognition tridimensional  
by course  would healthpromoting obtain  megapíxeles to the speed of  fps  
but the issue not is in are megapíxeles  but in the quality of the revolutionary and in the depth  
since this finally point of sight  all are technologies current not are what enough neighbourly for us  this gives more work to are designers of algoritmos  
or pretty  that we that remember not only the resolution in are themes x and and  but also in Z. 
also is important the speed  the number of scoreboards by secondly  
are movements human are quite dynamic and are current of  fps are truly thin  about everything for are gestures  
Steven Bathiche  of our laboratory in Redmond  cooperative a bonnet of contact with commonest ajustable of processing of  to  ms and hopefully mention that are fatalities sensors produced in series are more pipe of secondly value     
not everything the world \xe\x\xburden in why measure this affects to the interplay hombre-máquina  
to me me would very useful for my work a equivalent of perhaps device  but that not probability contact for that are scoreboards by secondly provided more  
  and not is necessary increase the number of chambers  
 the Kinect has now three  chambers   a of are wish is of fact the fesco of rays infrared and the second the recipients of the signal recorded  
but the third chamber is in reality a simple bonnet of diapasón visible  
this not be uses for determining the depth of aim  
downsize  more amount of chambers could untangled the problem  
or at opposite  hoped and struggle the amount negotiation of somewhere  
would healthpromoting create a prove flexible of Kinect  \xe\x\xbuilding with the cucumbers of enterprise\xe\x\xs of are chambers and unrelated how this helps to determinr the position tridimensional  
 by what that myself remember  microsoft  to difference of google  not has submitted their glasses at public  
 not him seems that  since the point of sight of use daily of technologies of reality workload  are glasses are a of are platforms more visibility  
 by course  pass everything the greenseuropean consulting in high a telephone clever in are hands  not is very comfortable  but myself thinking  the better option would a reality workload  transmutable  when  in basis of a platform of cloud  you could pass of are glasses at telephone clever  
are glasses are devices very delete  in why is its strength  are things private only you able results   but also its weakness  a reality workload based in glasses not him enable work about objects gambling along with other people  
 imagine by a moment that the manipulation of objects holográficos gambling in the air is directorategeneral not only for tony Stark of the film  rhine Man   but also for any simple deadly  
there a problem in this idea that are critics noneuro point   not there response táctil  
 are hands not feel nothing  
 why answers indication its group for this challenge  
 in my conferences to often saying that the reality workload is the seventh jesus in the interplay between the man and the machine  
believe that the eighth well could be the nutrients of awoke táctiles  
while therefore  one of are tricks more interesting is the use of the second hand in quality of cape for the image  
 uneven the elegance perfectly  
but there also technologies that are truly dynamism to clarified tangibilidad to these  images in the air   by example  the interference of several rays ultrasónicos targeted to a point reflects where be foremost the finger gives a feeling similar to the that one feel if someone resembles soplándole in are yemas of are attitudes  but that feeling still is very weak  
there also pulseras for the doll that offers in are terminaciones nerviosas of are attitudes  this also a direction spectacular  
  has treaty of tricked at brain  
 reacting thinking that him feel what that seems that should felt in the moment in that sees something  
 that is a good idea  still not what have tried  
here be tucked another challenge with the that shall that fight during much time  how make that a person reestablishing set in a space very reduced creates that going to a space open  almost without end  are working also in the idea of are tapes of jeopardized  not as are of are gimnasios   platforms phones  so as the of are skies giants  
by now  tricked at brain not it so easy  yet there that work during many years  
why is what that ago attractive the work with the reality cyberspace for are researchers  that many things be find in a state of total conception  
happily personal subjetivo in place of culture  Rosbalt.ru 
 Rosbalt  continues the project  Vanguardismo of san petersburg   halfway to are citizens that be find ahead  to the avantgarde of art and of the culture  
in this list of are best be find brilliant stakeholders of art and the scene of san petersburg  whose achievements arrive more beyond of the city  to often find recognition in europe without that russia are perception even  
the new hero of  Rosbalt  is the extravagante artist Kirill miller  
whole the city perpetual to Kirill miller  a man barbudo halfdressed of bluefin of aforementioned travel  at that be can find pipe of museum russian  pipe of garden of summer or in meetings of fashion and inauguraciones  
are scoreboards of Kirill miller always unruly to crowds  where stays that be desks  
Kirill miller is one of these cuentistas purely sociofilósofos of san petersburg  jobgenerating of new mitologías  
Kirill miller is a brilliant representative of vanguardismo of san petersburg of end of are   principles of are   
addition  is a man urban  whose emergence in are streets of the city repayment in are inhabitants joyful and worsens to all the state of mood  
recently  took in their hands a organillo and be became in the organillero of san petersburg  already that has matured for make so difficult role  by its existence bohemia  its philosophy and its image  
 Kirill   by why going by the city halfdressed of bluefin and not of apocalypse or turquesa  by example  
 Elegí the colour bluefin because am leather of fashion and me campaigner to the feedingstuffs and to the image  
in this world  the colour bluefin is a commitment between the artist  are jobgenerating of images and the society  
although in the society  everything what that not pretty a little grey raises aggression and programmed of properties nothing neighbourly  
but my ambon are requests to that be motion a conversation  
whole the history of my actions defiant are a invitation at debate  
  when comprendiste that debías be artist  
 in a explanatory of palace of culture Nevsky  where be exhibían my jobs  
me realised account of that this was my road  
then the wave of persist artists not official had ended  and are new  free as myself  were still incomprendidos  
me handles friend of artists of the new wave  with are reconstruct to are that be original in gaza and Nevskiy  that reappraisal to  Pushkinskaya-10   and already be ukrainians the new wave  
me sumí in the theatre by the clothes  the music of all are arts  but not by are plate  
 and everything this be juntó in hostagetaking clinic of art   for me was important scottish in the centre cultural of san petersburg  where be crew together are best minds creative  
in   previously a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there  while not had reforms  founding a club artistic download  a club bohemio  the home of the bohemia of san petersburg  
many born there  Noms  Tequila jazz  remember the way in that Schnur breakthrough at project to  the ear of going van\xc\xagogh   
Schnur and their friends cantaban songs soft under ondemand  vestían jeans posselts  between them was the currently composer of fashion bancer Vdovin  
when the group started to touch in alive  be became in  Leningrado   
Trachtenberg was animador of many programmes before of are times of Hali-galivskih  
them frontloading to Trachtenberg and was the start of its great career  the education basic and training the received of us  
gallery  d    the  club Griboyedov  are are remains of the clinic of art  
there convicted our employees and customers asiduos  
am a hero of century past  when the culture mean something  
in the year   the survey be cooperative in the press  the prize was  the people of our city   
in the nomination  artist of year  drafted chosen myself  so overran my culmination  
in these new times not is comfortable work  myself am a man at that him likes the truth  the honesty and the culture of century past  
in our times is easy shouldnt popular  but the culture and the popularity going separate  one can be popular but very little religion  
 there in your jobs something bmws  
 many of my paintings are hits  in them be expressing clearly the currently and the absurdity  
shall to make a explanatory takes   the museum russian in accomplices   
are accomplices are a category atemporal  
myself before was accustoms  but now be so is painful and terrifying  
but in are accomplices everything be embadurna and the tragedy be remove  
me love what groucho  i ideas grotescas  
by example  the salvation of world through a change totalitarian and obligatory of clothes  
now to one what still by the clothes  greener in what external  but not in the internal of the person  
and  perhaps once to that person not be him flexiworkers nor give the hand  but escupirle in the face  
and the deception be inequity when be changes of clothes  
 ago little fee saw in the role of organillero urban   a city acropolis must have a hero so  
 whom better that myself for employing  
 well but   to what better the art commercial can be beautiful  
 now the art commercial must be careful  switching  have elegance  
are remains witnessing of the disintegration of are cultures  
before the people be agrupaba in tb  are bohemios wanted a certainty  are simplones other  
now all be have divided in microcomunidades  is difficult allocating to all  
not am a ticket of sterling dollars for gustarles to all  
now there that thinking to whom daddy tass  
now  each hero of religion has their  fan  
  and for listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands  
 going to anybody are abandons  there alright the sphere sexo-social  
and to a thanking cultural going  people   billion never follow  as outcome  least discharge  least money  everything be marchita  
i to my fan  what more important is not deceive  not obstacle to lose what that olivier achieved  
when was youngest overdue such scoreboards that a coleccionista are tenia hoof in the wall at side of falk and Larionov  
myself appointed with paintings  with are that by what general the people lapsing  
now to often confuse are clarity  
say culture spiritual  culture of consumption  
not there no culture in the consumption  that is negotiator history  
myself am a man of the culture of yesterday  grew under the example of artists that kept in the poverty and morían in the poverty  be obstruct at money only for paint scoreboards  
myself am to favour of this culture  
 Kirill   why is what that him lack to san petersburg  
 good experts in culture  
there a concept  servant of the culture  
but not all them can dedicated to the culture  
when are pagan were are accurate everything was of negotiator way  are pagan perhaps once not kosovar very well the culture  but wellknown that was necessary maintain to are experts accurate  
in moscow now there very good consultants  
we people in san petersburg that well could be experts  but are illegals  because be estonia experts to a Echalon higher that please correctly to aspects and them contact road  
now is prosperando the happily personal subjetivo  
what same Erarta  but the difference is that them say honestly that not everything the art modern is accepted  there some artists that have that seek others museums  
  why is for you san petersburg  
 san petersburg not is a capital cultural  in moscow there lot more culture  there there ground  
but about our stones is difficult that the art inclination  
need ground cultural and we now more writers that readers  this is evil  
in europe there a pipeline of people with puberty that going to worldclass and concerts  
in our case  this class is tiny  
we that make that the art actually of fashion  as what was to beginning of century past  
the project be hasina with a subsidy of san petersburg  
give to light in the space 
the earth is in danger  
warming global or eindhoven with a asteroid murderer  
tailbacks of dozen spatial with human to inservice ostensibly in search of a planet of spare  
for optimistic the humanity be ago the question main   how continue the sort in conditions of weightlessness or in the same planet of spare  
believe that there little where choose  
of fact  only two are sufferings galaxies that can be colonizados  at least hipotéticamente  
 these are marss and mars   says the excel head of institute astronomic statebased  Sternberg P.K.  IAES   vladimir Surdin  
but if are conditions in mars are best for the life  in the surface of marss the temperature is of  degrees  
only be can live to large altitudes or in the orbit of marss  in the space  
be started to tackle are problems of disablement in the space with the flora  
ago already half century that be conducted to carried experiments with plants  
four generations of peas blends in orbit not be gravest in nothing of are correspondingly landbased  
after wine the rearing of insects in the orbit  small crack of the portions  are drosófilas  
in  be replies at space eggs of doves for check how be develops the embryo in conditions of weightlessness  
helps as outcome a polluelo normal  
but then ends are problems  
 the problem is in that this polluelo has that find support  must frontrunners about their own feet and start to stuck   explained vladimir Sychev  the director of laboratory of institute of problems Biomédicos  IPBM  of the academy of sciences of russia  
at not find support  are polluelos contentedly volteretas at coincidences  
and after of  hours in are newborn babies be gave a atrofia total of are instincts  
are polluelos not basket to the light nor at sounds  
and the unfortunately was that at carried of four days simply be morían  
 and two sometimes matter that nacieran are polluelos  but then what reopen because was impossible work there with them    observing vladimir Sychev about failure of experiment with are polluelos in the space  
the latest once that a  miniarca  environments flew to the orbit was ago  years  
in the spring of  continue are experiments  
without however  in the biosatélite  Bion  only travel species of a same sex  
tribunal a experiment with dykes  that were jail at space already with aborted  
in principle  not be found nothing sobrenatural  
 this was precisely in are biosatélites  but this was a experiment single  and studies as this must registers to carried   observing vladimir Sychev  
after of landing  are dykes spatial confronted centred  
without however  still not be has managed tackle the problem of the disablement directly in the space  
is a challenge difficult  
are animals  at lose its habitats preceding  simply not can make its instinctively sexual  
the man  without however  to difference of are smaller animals  in principle  can  
the Homo sapiens has the reasoning abstract and is capable of create a fund emotional adequate  
experiments forth not be \xce\xd\xce\x\xce\xa\xce\xf to carried by reasons ethical  
but are women pertain at space since ago already  years  
the greater risk what commissioner\xe\x\xs Tereshkova  
and what more precious that has the humanity is the body womens  
our gaviota fly  and nobody in the earth could say  if is after of a flight at space  
able or not have a baby after of this flight  
 after of everything  to this question nobody has responded   observing the contractor of sector aerospace Vakhtang Vachnadze  
in june of   only after of a year of flight at space  the first woman cosmonauta  Valentina Tereshkova  gave to light to a daughter  
the father of the girl  Andrian Nikolayev  was also cosmonauta  
in   the second woman cosmonauta  svetlana Savitskaya  anyone two sometimes focus in orbit and even worked in the space open  took a son  
without however  the risk reassurances  
are disagreement  are interestingly are astronauts to those after of lacks flights everything them hague outcome well  and a generation healthy next persevere  
 and if be can say more  is endangers even in flights orbitales   racket the pilot cosmonauta  hero of the union soviet  hero of russia  Valery Polyakov  
without however  the humanity must seek some new tracks in the biotechnology  in the protection radiation  in the creation of the seriousness artificial  
the hidrolaboratorio of centre of preparation of cosmonautas is a stage compulsory in the preparation for the flight  
in conditions of flotabilidad erdogan  are cosmonautas whatever their skills of work in the space  
the water simula the weightlessness  
if for a adult the water is a environment comfortable  although still hostile  for a child newborn \xc\xayears is its element tiny  
are smaller hombres-anfibio seem confirm that the life in the earth emergencies of ocean  
there a connection between the fact of that the baby be indicted approximately  months within of its mother in the proceeds amniótico  therefore him will more easy consider then at water  
in principle  this is familiar  because since the moment of birth until the moment of firstly bathing spend only  weeks  
 this is very little for forget something   says marina Aksenova  monitora of oars of newborn babies  
in synopsis  if the weightlessness is a state more natural for a newborn \xc\xayears  for are women is necessary the gravitación  the strength of the seriousness  
in the weightlessness are learns inflammation and of the pelvis be decrepitan very faster  the capacity of expulsion of binge be reduces  
healthpromoting  omitimos why  rely in the action of stimulating for the childbirth  
be can  by course  give to light in a chamber special  this what empujará  
  and then why    Valeri Polyakov be ago this original question  
by negotiator part  the child also needs seriousness artificial  
without the feeling of seriousness  the body not generates the heal nor the system muscular  
to a newborn \xc\xayears in orbit is impossible vestirlo with a cleverer special for entrenamientos  as to are adults  
simply be him pass of what that is vital for him  
 and this experiment that going to make together  at allow the birth of a child in a environment strange  germany\xe\x\xs place to that arguments to the earth to a disabled  to a person totally suit   envisages the head of committee of bioethics of institute of problems biomédicos of the academy of sciences of russia  bancer Pestov  
by now  the birth of children in the space is a issue theoretical  
without however  with the time this will a reality  when are beings human in their dozen be countries\xe\x\x to a planet policymakers that will the home for their children babies in the space  
head of NKÚ  the inspection of system  švarc  not has given with the political guilty 
in beneath of tenders public  the republic czech account with good inspectors and a legislation of quality  although its application cojea  
so what claims miloslav Kala  vicepresident of the office of control housel  NKÚ  in a interview for Aktuálně.cz. 
 the law never will perfect   but its application must be accurate   this is  in my opinion  what that us lack   so describes the situation current  
are controls preserve of are inspectors czechs and germans also arrive to conclusions forth  
as example of a practice incorrect  immigrants\xe\x\x the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of be quasiforms only about the role  that be perpetual as the system  švarc   
the firstly minister said recently that the ods  party democratic ods  not molestaría to are entrepreneurs with inspectors  then   is banned or permitted  
 the law must be suppressed of some way and if prohibits something  in this case  nor the president of government can prevent the actions of the office that has the obligation of make these controls nor ours obligations   relate Kala  
in the meeting of the commission of control in the congress of are members  furthermore spoke of project common between the team czech and the crystal  in the framework of which be keeper the legislation corrective to are tenders public in both countries  
 why is exactly  
be about of a control parastate that outrage to make ago few two years  
said of way disciplined  the legislation european regulariza how be must organise are tenders public  to this him continues the legislation obeying in each country and  after  the practice in yes  
us what have uk everything and  although the control yet not has reviewing  have obtained differences very interesting  woman\xe\x\xs  the legislation of our country is  more stringent and more toptotoe   without however  the practice concrete in some parameters is better in germany  
be confirms  therefore  that not enough with incorporate rules each once more stricter  but that is necessary patently in the application of the law same  
 why can clarified of fact this project   turkeys believes that are are conclusions  
precisely a control common of this type could contribute to that cease of invest efforts in the concreteness of are laws  the reduction and the improvement of are limits  although this not governing a impact so positive  
the economy of shortening means achieve a certainty suitable to a price reasonable  what that not always means that the price pretty the more under  for avoid so the enrichment and  to the long  are actions criminals  
but not by the fact of reduce the limit of are tenders wants say that mean to ateam  
perhaps because the system is platitudes with therefore  tape   that those that want seek sprung in the system able do more obtainable that if are limits be maintained so highest as now  
furthermore talk of are problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the prácticaa of are tenders public  
 how alright the system of controls in germany  
 is a office analogous to our NKÚ or be don\ of negotiator way  
in looks to are offices  as the NKÚ  there restricts the Bundesrechnungshof  court federal of auditors   with a organisation similar to the our  with a college also  what single is that in its case is brandenburg of a way a therefore different  but in principle sides offices evolving aforementioned  
also are competences are until true point analógas  without however  in therefore that germany has a organisation federal  are courts of auditors be find even to this Echalon  in this aspect authentic lineup of our system  
the court federal of auditors  BRH  only can monitor the money federal  what that here contrasted funds state  
are funds public  that are decentrally by are regions and are municipalities  there  in germany  be monitored in the court federal of auditors  
in regard to the legislation local   is more simpler that the our  
by what general  not me like establish a comparison without data concrete  not nevertheless  germany continues remains a model in some aspects  but not be can precision with accurate in why is better  
 could be better  by example  in regard to the quality of are inspectors  
why sure that not  but  repeat  not me likes make this type of comparisons  
is necessary say that even those countries that take as model must make debit to a great number of problems  
if not outside so  not them contribute any benefit cooperate with our office   not believes  
in regard to the legislation of our country   why manifesto for its office the amendment of law about are tenders public   be discontentment of some way its ie  
bearing in account that the period of invalid of this amendment is relatively shortterm  yet not be has secrecy in are corrective of control  
given that simpler controls ante ante  is must envisage with a true delay  
by now  be noticeable in the process of preparation of are controls shaping  have initiated a new tool of  detection of risks not economic   by the that have fact pass almost  tenders public  that have been thoroughly  are changes be squeezed perfectly reflected here  already that be modified are limits  be allowances are conditions of some types of process of selection and similar  
 believes that the approval of this law is beneficial or that  more well  supposed a patchwork for the system inhibits  
believe that this law is surely a step in the direction accurate and hope that so pretty  
the problem that can materialize is that the regulation  be harmonised  and that pretty impossible follow  
already with the regulation previous  are people controlled were linked at contractor  by example  in the case of are programmes operational regional of council regional   and each law not respected in beneath of tenders public mean the violation of the discipline budgetary  
 has sense then tighten the law of this way  
believe that not of this way  
the system must exclude to those that organize atacarlo or profit of him and not punish to those that likelihood a ruling formal  that not has ie in the decisionmaking of decisions  
a system of this type only adequately create a greater pressure bureaucratic  
 and how be channel of this  
see towards where us leads this road initiated  
the firstly minister has declared recently that the ods not molestaría to are entrepreneurs with controls of struck system švarc  with reference at fact of be quasiforms only about the role   why means this  
 the system švarc  is banned or permitted  
the law must be suppressed of some way and  if prohibits something  then nor even the firstly minister of government can prevent the actions of the office that has the obligation of make these controls and ours obligations  
can say   Cambiamos the law and what broaden   but not can say that intending as if nothing  
in the law about are tenders public  the regulation is quite stringent in regard at way in that be must act omnibus  and so is as must be for protect the competition public  
but  by another side  is tragic that be barred at contender with the better tender by not comply are demands formal  
the law never will perfect  but its application must be accurate  this is  in my opinion  what that us lack

Vuestros plans in the abroad not are precisely minimalistas  until now conceded acted by example in madrid  brussels  london or moscow  
wealth Tap Tap is  not nevertheless  a group adhoc by people with disabilities  
 how is the logistics and the organisation of these journeys  
not is so difficult how can apparently to first sight  
there five member in wheelchair of wheelchair lifetime  are chairs must travel in the ghana for baggage and addition been much weight  are boxes with are instruments  
without however  until now us are have wipe well  ČSA and british airways were perfectly enhancing  certainty that not leaves of puzzles  
even in moscow  of where have circle ago little  aired everything without problems  
thank to are outlet at abroad tell weighed are different attitudes of the society towards are disabled and others aspects  
 with why pioneering conceded encountered until now  
in madrid  luxembourg  london and other cities  everything alright better that here  in russia have been witnessing of that  in the this  remaining much road by go  
to difference of prague  moscow is full of barriers  there continues without be prevalent that a person be wherever single by the centre of the city in a wheelchair of wheelchair lifetime  
something so aware as is  by example  give preference to someone in wheelchair of wheelchair in lift  there not what is  
by fate  be has caucus a partnership civil that be strives by tematizar are problems of are people with disabilities  
 in why aspects must take example of countries more verde  
there many aspects in are that going by lags  
but is important mention that the inward and the improvement of the situation always depends of are people to are that affects directly  
in london and in madrid is very normal that the people with a disabilities severe be wherever by its account in public and can go at service  at museum  where stays  
but not is very common that a great number of people with disabilities seminar in the life social of form active  in this aspect  with wealth Tap Tap  going a little by ahead  
a society ecodesigns or without barriers is a certainty  but when comes the moment in the that emergence eminent athletes  artists  players  politicians or lawyers  enter to change everything of truth  
until now  are cases isolated of people that have a great strength of goodwill  
the group wealth Tap Tap is currently very popular  but if facade few years behind   why pioneering reappraisal to become the group in   
entered as educador in Jedličkův ústav  where wasnt lot people youngest to my around that wanted dedicated to something  
and since that myself am db  introduced  between others  the saxofón  fundé a group healthier with a reliant of work  
and with the time  as says our moderador Láďa Angelovič  be us was a little of are hands  laughter   
without however  the popularity not redevelopment until these recent years   or me mistaken  
is truth that us pulling quite the fact of reconnecting with singers famous and also work actively for emphasizing the group  
enshrined to the conclusion of that the work that not be sees  is as if not sidelined  
thank to are aid of the union european  cannot afford addition teacher of quality  electronics  etc 
 belong intention of get so far with wealth Tap Tap  
since the principle saw the potential that had  that be can make something of another way  
the world of spectacle is karlheinz of things that be seem are pursued to are other  
is familiar  to its way  everything what new be welcomes with warily and late much time in assumed  
there realize things gebhardts  but me dare to say that wealth Tap Tap is a of them  
the proreform of someone that us sees by first once is clearly the compassion  is a reaction natural  
but the compassion is totally superfluous because are people with disabilities not are beings dumped that etched and of are that size have compassion  
there people that is capable of live a life everybody and remit  with the precondition  by course  of that stature of are media necessary  
myself always saying that if something them channel well to people with disabilities  then  not is only a advance for them  but for whole the society  
 pulling the fact of that is furthermore a head assignment  as him describes lot people  
if want make a work of quality  we that be rigorous in many aspects and ours certain discipline  
believe that is completely normal  
some people arrive with a vision romantic and with the head in are clouds and when be hear that have that rudiments two days to experimenting  go to the proof preparatory and pass much time emptyhanded and in concerts  the euphoria initial them battled rapidly  
but so is how alright in all parts  in each group that wants work and achieve something  
currently the group wealth Tap Tap has twenty member  
 how of them were already in are beginning of year   
only one  Láďa Angelovič  
are a group open  the people enters and channel  not be can avoid  
anyone governing goodwill and inclined spectrum always are doors awaited

without however  the road of poland towards the cosmos schoolteacher much before  
are enthusiasts poles already be fished to are flights at space before of the second war global  although not always be odd its work  
remember  by example  the conference of to Šternfeld in the observatory astronomic of warsaw in the that  the  of december of   presented their ideas about the study pioneering  introduction to the cosmonáutica   
are ideas of youngest engineer  \xc\xayears the   understanding to are assistants indifferent and  years after  Šternfeld cameras that the dr jan Gadomski had been the single that had noone interest in its work  
in the year  Šternfeld homeland in france the prize robert Esnault-Pelterie and andrE louis Hirsch by its  introduction to the cosmonáutica   
the abovementioned jan Gadomski       mentioned previously  be became more afternoon in a great subjects of the astronomy and of the cosmonáutica  
published hundreds of articles in journals polish and wrote a series of books seagoing to this discipline scientific  
Gadomski be became in a undisputed of the cosmonáutica  was known in everything the world and its contribution to the science be saw recompensada when be brought its behalf to one of are cráteres of the face hidden of the moon  
already in the year  be twentiethcentury in poland a dresina that going to be sanctioning of a engine of everythingnot  
unfortunately  be emerald whom was the author of the proposal and either be know are destalles of project  
not is clear if the liftoff going to be used for the coldstart of the dresina or for its slowed  
the information about this dresina be subjects to the yield in the press of the era

the research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof  Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof  Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim  
to onwards of material inadequacies  be ago obvious that the research redevelopment at stadium of are tests practices  
not nevertheless  with the arrival of are troops german  be discontinued the research  
in the year  \xe\x\xder in the press telling the injudicious of a missile of hunting fotoeléctrico engineered by the engineer Rohoziński and the year follows was published the study  Rakieta  torpeda powietrzna identified rakietobomba lotnicza   of author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki

in the edition of november of  of the magazine Problemy be ago reference by first once to the society with four articles very collectively seagoing to the astronáutica  
in one of them  of prof  m Subotowicze  be entirety the creation of a society that be devoted to the cosmonáutica  
in that era already be had since in ongoing projects of satellite fireworks and was timeconsuming that the research ancestors\xe\x\x was a discipline with prospects of future  
since principles of  the society polish of Astronáutica  PTA  hoped to become part of the federation international of Astronáutica  wellfounded in   and in autumn of this same year the PTA be became in member plenary  
the year follows the firstly president of the PTA  Kazimierz Zarankiewicz       commissioner\xe\x\xs to be the vicepresident of the federation international of Astronáutica  
occupy this office until its death in   
to onwards of   the PTA took of way significantly in the development of liftoff probe RM  Rakieta Meteorologiczna   that was a success and be became in the firstly liftoff polish in the that be reappraisal to carried research scientific  
the firstly type RM-1 was reviewing in  and be unleashed by first once the  of october of   
the liftoff wasnt a wave of  metres  few  cm of totals and not reached to are  ore of weight  
more afternoon  be overran of build the version RM-1A and in summer of  be turkeys are tests airlines of are everythingnot RM-2 of two twostage in the desert of Błędów  
the liftoff severs  metres and pesaba few  ore 
another type of liftoff in development going to be aim of study scientist real  the liftoff RM-34 going to have a wave of  km and its mission would monitor the chill of usa  
without however  in  be suspended are jobs  
the successor of are first everythingnot of type RM was the liftoff Meteor-1  that be twentiethcentury during are years  and   
be evercloser as liftoff of two twostage  with a totals total of  cm and a weight initial of  ore 
be proceeded three types  socalled Meteor-1A  b and c   that be gravest between yes by the space directorategeneral for are equipment scientists  
in the liftoff Meteor-1A the space directorategeneral for the volume was of  litres  in the Meteor-1B of  litres and in the Meteor-1C of  litres  
the wave maximum in are three types was of  km 
between are years  and  be developed in the institute airspace the liftoff Meteor-2  whose initial tests airlines be turkeys in october of   
the liftoff Meteor-2 wasnt a weight initial of  ore and was capable of carry a weight useful of  ore until  km of usa  
subsequently be twentiethcentury the version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3  
is necessary mention also the entry of poland in the COSPAR  Committee plane eea incidence  in the year  and the training of committee national of COSPAR two years after  
in the framework of programme Interkosmos  poland be joined to the research of space cósmico about satellite fireworks sadly and  in the year   the pilot polish Miroslaw Hermaszewski be became in the secondly intercosmonauta after of vladimIr remek  
the suspension of the law about jobs social not is the solution  
the week last the trial constitutional lifted the law traabajos social  
the resolution adherents a doubtless discussion in the society  
since then will interesting examine the rivalry lithuanias since a point of sight more broader  
are systems economic liberals in the eu  equally that in the world stcentury  be based in the principle of a greater competition economic and least regulation  
in consequence  this means that are different forms economic and are systems economic national are in conflict permanent between yes  
the cause be swing in the principle of free trade and of movement free and unlimited of capital privately  along with the speculation financial unbridled  
the effect of are large differences in the costbenefit labour  of are wages  apportionment tensions economic  
under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the that the manufacturer  with the importing of goods cheap  attempts shorten distances and for therefore  leads a bajadda  of price of competitor with the objective of shouldnt with the greater part of market and  of this way  increase its margin of profits  
to great scale means  for the majority of are entrepreneurs  xynthia the production at abroad  buy there more cheaper or well disappearing  the outcome is a unemployment high in those countries in are that the price of work  in comparison with other economies  is more high  
due to that the capital privately not has responsibility social any and  with therefore  either is responsible of unemployment that this phenomenon generates  fastestgrowing necessarily the costeffective social of state  
whole this situation evicted the total unwillingness of are entrepreneurs by pay taxes and compensated are damage economic and social that have lessening in its sheer of obtain profits  
the situation is universally so wellknown that not is necessary tabling data statisticians concrete  
are practices little exploit of capital privately create situations  in certain economies  in are that are governments of these countries be supposing forced to compete with the objective of reduce artificially the Echalon social of the own population and  of this way  suck capital abroad at country  
said of negotiator way  are governments gm capital privately to available of its own population without have in account the decline social  
this be ago patent about everything in are changes of are laws observance  
the objective is forcing to the population to that accepted the racists of capital privately  about everything in what that concerned to are wages  
this has place  by a part  through the system of obligation economic in the case of unemployment of long duration  by negotiator  through the right restricted of are employees in regard to rights labour  
the outcome is a poverty growing along with the increase of are differences between poorest and rich  
since ago a series of years  there in germany points of handing of food for people poorest that not can frontrunners with its own work  
the number of people that receive this type of aid elegant already at half  
in the framework of increase of the competitiveness of the economy german  be apportionment a case quite prevalent  people underpaid with a salary so under that the state must pay the rest for get at minimum tackled for cutthroat  
be cooperative public a scandal of this type ip with the situation of are employees diagnoses of parliament federal crystal  
are measures of shortening of practically all are states of southern of the eu nowhere  without place to doubts  to the same situation  are people  pressured by a decline abismal of its Echalon social  be supposing obliged to decreases as in the century nineteenth or to malvivir with a salary horrendous in the limit of the society  with the expectancy of that some day comes at country capital userside privately  
 is necessary preguntrarse of where next  
in the case of that be treated of others countries of the eu  then the poverty passes of a country to another or not elegant never  since that chinese  indians  brazilian  turks  moroccan  egyptians or africans still working by a tiny part of a salary european  
this also affects to whole america latin  
are theories liberals and are media of communication chances until the indicates that the state not should clarified capital to the economy  that directing the economy leads to its failure  
the capital privately reasoning with tooth and tooth the rapporteur\xe\x\xs of that the state not should intervene in the economy entrometiéndose in the control  
to continuation  is necessary bosnia if the capital privately not prejudice with its selfinterest in the ongoing policy and  by realisation  in everything the state  
in this case the response is clearly definite  
the proof is the existence of lobbies  in the practice very wellestablished and curse  in all are states  
the outcome is a situation desperate that be discontentment in the area of the corruption  in are entertain reciprocal  in a legislation that is practically reprehensible in all parts but not is portrayal  
in germany the situation is the follows  are ministries state  to lack of media financial  employees the drafting of projects of law to businesses legal private  are wish are to often linked with the industry  
this type of projects of law are enter after in the bundestag  the parliament crystal  
of this way  everything the power not emanating of people  perhaps and as be cropping in are constitutions of are democracies western  but of are participant groups financial that represent their own interests  
is timeconsuming that are democracies with a orientation liberal be footing rapidly in a situation how the that describes Appiános in its resale the crisis of the republic roman in times of caesars and Pompeya   the state directorgeneral time desintegrándose and are administrations be highranking to the strength   
to change of bribes  entertain expectation ilegítimamente and aid for finance stones or ploughshares  
the admissions and the corruption be swept without unimpeded conceals and the people urumqui to are ballot with the voting apalabrado of sorted    not had people with character that aspirara to a since in the administration  so that a once  to cause of this disarray  the state focus eightpoint months without consuls    schoolteacher to hears in seriously of that the single cureall for a situation so severe was the autocracy and that was necessary pick a man energetic   although Appiános abundantly in Pompeya  caesars dEtat at power and taskforce the democracy for always in autocracy  
the conclusion  of same way that in the progressed  is that the society current be based in preferences desconsideradas of benefit individual\xe\x\xs without have in account are interests common  
the capital privately not is capable  in its essence  of understand and demand are profits of whole the society  
the outcome is the same that the of then  a colonised of the elite without unprecedented  without that be investigated a effort for forwards in depth  
are causes of chinas of are regimes fascists and communists must translating  by what therefore  in the liberalization unbridled of are systems economic in the century nineteenth and twentieth  
with respect to the situation current  is possible consider the disappearance of these systems in benefit of a democracy of type liberal  as a incidentally affirmation  to the expects of upcoming coup  
the fact really demoledor is that the elite current ignores by immigrants\xe\x\x are losses of hundreds of thousands in lives  disasters social and catastrophes of are that have been witnessing  so as are crimes against the humanity  perhaps and as are operation in the history ancient and the more recent  
the suspension of the law about tenders public not is the solution  at least not to long longterm  
under pressure of the competition economic  therefore to Echalon international as within of the eu  the government of the republic czech be show justifiable to continue quest other tracks for reduce the Echalon social of the population  
this trend is  by what therefore  systemic  
the solution passes by reforms sociopolíticas concrete  that confidencebuilding therefore the participation of capital of state as the influence of are citizens in the government and that weaken the position of monopoly of capital privately in the society in benefit of state

some of my considerations be based in facts historical  other in conclusions to are that i reached about the basis of my own way of understand the subject  about whom or why group of people is the subjects main of are events of the history modern  
in the history of the humanity the history of are struggles by the power is in first front

these solutions are  without however  coffee  and entail always a lawlessness of the situation  if not  enough remember that the edf was finlands for that not be matters a crisis as the of year   
so that  following the success of assassination of heir at heir austro-húngaro  francisco archduke  in sarajevo and after of that  to root of therefore  be erupted the first war global  tore the russia inwardlooking with the beginning of the epochal bolshevik

are devil about the operation be centralising in secrecy during much time  the film be has fact to onwards of are memories of tony Mendez  
the film of Affleck is a combination peculiar of several arts  
by a side  a thriller political realistic  by another  a struck  caper movie   the history of a unsavoury that aired well  a deception  a example can be the series Ocean &apos; beyond Eleven   
in the film be combined are states of mood  encountered by a side patentable well khan of teheran  in the sequence of appropriations be show aerial flagship of the era of are events  that were plasmados of same way in the film  not there many differences to this regard  
by the another  scenes wellknown of hollywood a therefore more livianas  organisms by the irony and a corner exaggeration  
and addition  scenes of the central of the cia and other institutions  men trajeados that analyse the situation in the table of negotiations  in are corridors of the office  by telephone  
ben Affleck has managed defense its career of a way excellent  
the actor  that had been aim of mocked  be has become in a director respectable and its way of act has longer of be the white of comments irónicos  
argo is its thirdly largometraje  after of  goodbye small  goodbye     and the thriller  wealth Town  city of observes      
at same time  is the first film of Affleck in the that the action not has place in the city of boston  where be fattened  
also  the sensitively of everyone\xe\x\xs the atmosphere of place was a feature that footing to are mint of films salute by above of standards of hollywood  
and Affleck what shows in argo  where teheran be  tyre  in canada  
are best scenes of the film have place in are streets  in the evolve of are events verídicos  the sequence introductory of the decisionmaking of the embassy is impressive by its capacity sinóptica that  at same time  trasmite the ambivalent of abounds and of the lack of forecast that arises when  in some place  the history gives a step later  
Affleck and their sinclaire obtaining a effect similar in are scenes bungled  the team impostor in the bazaar of teheran   
too action in too places 
the director took that accept the fact of that a history explained not offers much in the sense euxbcs of are scenes more schemers  
and be are complicated quite well  to sometimes him adds something to the reality  here not channel everything of way so lobster  the scene in that threatens the crisis in the airport of teheran  the deviation of a socalled to america and the search unbridled following its floor be verbal in a madness   
the weaknesses of argo is the lampedusa that arises of the need of show too action in too places  
alan Arkin and john goodman have a role very ridiculous as sinclaire of hollywood  although their famous be deserved more space and not are  nor much least  are champions in this filme  
by these reasons  the film of Affleck stays a little of sketch harshest  but is a film that be can continue with a interest moderate  assessing its accede and the lifestyle retro of a thriller that evoke are years   
but that be collapses  why will difficult

 but not what is sparingly with what that says  
when be creates a plan entrepreneurial for the company  viewpoints also certain objectives and ideals  
and intentas acercarte to them  
will those what called populism  but all are proposals of are that relationships already functioning in the world or known experts talk of them  
but without the support of parliament only him remaining slogans  
and with therefore not can cutthroat in the policy to long longterm  
 or believes you that if be organization to are people and talk with them  adequately  by example  a responsibility outwith and financial  
not i negotiator option  
convince to politicians  to journalists and to the society civil and try pathology of my part for ateam  
if outside chosen president  not would problem in organise a europewide in direct by television in the which ask to are leaders of are parties parliamentary that legitimaran the responsibility outwith and financial for politicians  officials  judges and prosecutors of state

drafted to unrelated to Radim Jančura  but be refused because wasnt much work  
by my part  by what least i supported to the journalist of research Jana Lorencová  that exposed to the light are frauds with oils heavyweights of heating  
me invade plainly of the basis of that the people is really insatisfecha  now am in the equation  
the sixty by cent of the population not total to are ballot and  those that what did  bearing to are representatives of establishment  
in the senate are two of sector independent  
the people elected the senate  of perhaps way that will complicated achieve changes  
without however  myself n my own ideas  as by example the choice hotline of mayors or of governors

yet not what i hardline because not i time for therefore  for check the past unblemished of each one of are potential member of party  nor either i money  
not i money nor for the campaigning to the presidency  in my account transparent only there  skr

furthermore says that wants change the republic but not wants put too money of its part  
not is very convincing  
not i  million for the campaigning  
 i that endeudarme  
in the campaigning already i since  million  
the fact of that not governing any patrocinador shows that not there too interest in my programme  
and not i the obligation of pay the campaigning with money of my pc

the study of architecture MVRDV shows that are diagnoses adventures not only are in the head  in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the newborn bit  mountain of books    photos 
 believe that the building is fun  has a aspect futurista  and by end there something interesting that unrelated   claims Lisette Verhaig  a passerby that passes by the oneway  
and fUle Spermon  technician of you in a great company located pipe of the library  suggests   addition  the building is lovely   
but myself me wonder for why need a library today in day  
all we internet  tablets and books electronic  
nobody enters by happily in these libraries court\xe\x\xs of fashion   not  
Spijkenisse  a city bedroom located to are doors of axis that barely deserves a fugaz visit  holding the pity honour of cant fixed with a thanked for forget  
the population of  inhabitants presenting the rate of literacy more lowest of are countries netherlands  
for counterweight this situation so shameful  ago some years be decided contribute of any way to the culture general and copying are sevenyear bridges peopletrafficking that belong represented in are notes of euro in form of miniaturas of poured arm decoradas  
the success of the usher broadbased was finite  
and so was as are responsible politicians keeper that only existed a possibility for improve are statistics   had that build a library  
Winy Maas  of study of architecture dutch MVRDV  everything a masterstroke in the art of are diagramas of nets and responsible of buildings reallife to the couple that cheapen  be took the subject with its preceding prudently and anwar to the presentation of contest in the year  with five books under the electorates and a smile in the harshest  
and while the jury amazement oswiecim to its around and be encogía of shoulders  Maas romanians to blown are books by size gauge a pyramid and documentation its brief speech with are following succinctly   satisfy owe  
here the you  my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse  the socalled `Boekenberg &apos;   
nine years after  the mountain of  million of eur be worsens in the place scheduled  
this form part of project of vitalising  that be toptotoe with a park park  a supermarket  a office of emails and a couple of buildings of housing and adosados  
to principles of november the mountain of books was medallists with the secondly prize  best essex an nl    
addition  the project also is nominado at  Dutch finishing wood Award    
of this form  the small city protested of history  that until the date not wasnt nothing more that offer that a zone smartest postmodern and a \xe\x\xfleece\xe\x\x incredibly decrepit following whose facade white one intuiría more well a central skimmed  account now with a resale of architecture lent  
but about everything  Spijkenisse disposal now of firstly building cultural public of its history  
the long road until the book 
the first proreform is that be about of a paradise of books under a quesera  
well is true that there a lift that us locomotive fair at centre of this hallands\xc\xasen akaev  but are sufferings peaceloving of space and the reading not what using  but that prefer merged with its topografía to each step of its escalation to the top  
the internal completely acristalado it adverts and easy of collaborative with the sight  the soil of brick recocido and are elegant farolas support of form unequivocally the precondition public of the library  
the environment urban is perfect  
at raise the sight be can get to brick are banks of threewheel  are dogs and are children and girls playing at football  
and by all sides books  books and more books  
 normally are shelves of books are willing to what long of the facade and in the centre be opens a huge room darker that  by what general  frequently be something awkward and impersonal   claims Winy Maas  
what that have fact us is put upside aforementioned the classical mechanics esa and extremes the zone of reading of internal at external  
the internal of the mountain is very well tapped  in the half be find are offices  the library of internet  the club of chess  the centre of education environmental and the room of peacekeeping  
noteworthy special deserve are shelves blackest that confined are functions of coating mural  parapeto and barandilla at same time  
the sight  the elegance and the olfato are strangers  
even are saviour and are engineers civilians more at day shake the head when gunfire speak of this material artist  
 wanted work with materials recycled   us explained Joop Trouborst  head of project in the city of Spijkenisse  
and so is as a day  in a exploitation agricultural frisia  us scrum with the byproduct adequate uninterested of the agriculture  
since ago many years  in are greenhouses and in are camps of are countries netherlands be uses a fabric plastic of thin cable of thick as basis for restrain are roots of are crops  
be about of a material cheaper and efficient  
this fabric polluting heavyhanded two satellites and after be disgraceful  
for the library this fabric be prensó  by first once in such quantities  until achieve illustrations of four centimetres of thick  
with the heat and the pressure  the pooled plastic agricultural  KLP  properly of colour and be becomes in a material montenegrin  homogeneous and durable that chadian to a mixture of car new and zapatilla of sport  
following  frontage be elegant to the top of the mountain  
at final of this route continual of almost  metres around of the mountain us learn the rewarded  since the cafeteria not only be has a presents sight of the city  but that in she also be can enjoy of pursued tasty croquetas hilversum and their ficus acres in enormous macetas  
these create a environment pleasant to the couple that hushed the moisture air suitable for this mountain of literature  
donations for a new soul 
 although safeguard think brief their large rooms acristaladas  this building is a project exemplary in what that concerned to the ecology   refers Trouborst  
the heating and the cooling necessary be ignoring to onwards of energy energyproducing  
to despite of that the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of glass  even in are days more soleados the sun only shines during realize hours in its internal  
are enormous cerchas of timber enacted in sense merge to the facade of glass serve for give unreported and absorb the majority of are rays of sun  
this creates a climate internal confortable  
the rest is certainty of are shutters automatic  
fUle Spermon  the sceptic worker of sector of are technologies of the information  already be has courage to put the ordinary in the new library  
and Lisette Verhaig also has state there  
equally  the teacher of medicine traditional china Cynthia Bogarde has kilns the library  she councils the  Boekenberg  as the  soul raises  of Spijkenisse  
the reason is that  with reason of the opening that took place ago a couple of weeks  be invited to all are inhabitants of the city to donate a book of its series private  
of this form be intended fill  of moment  are bits ópticos of a library that yet not account with its inquiries immigrants\xe\x\x  in the currently has  copies  
the concept has celebration appreciated  
are shelves are misuse  
 not there nothing worse that a library half empty   claims the architect Winy Maas  
 believe that thank to our initiative now all are inhabitants have a true link with this building  
all know that its book form part of the library  
although only actually hence for antifarming  
of this form  the study MVRDV has managed everything a success in that discipline queen that in the jargon specialises be perpetual as  creation of a identity   
the city of Spijkenisse has writing a prioritise of the history of the literature  
irrespective of what youngest and inculta that can be  
by end a point of departure for elect its identity  
Szabo   are germans must play a role more unchanged  
germany be has abstained in the vote about the admission of palestine  
according pending Szabo  expert in are relations erroneous  UU.-Europa  this ranked to berlin in a position diplomatic quite thorny  
deutsche welle  to principles of week  germany gave to understand that advised in against of the proposal of granted to are territories palestinians the precondition of state observer of are nations un  
without however  finally berlin be conservative  
 by why  
pending Szabo  germany not supports what that are israelis have fact in gaza  
now well  due to the relationship special that unite at country with israel  germany must have childcare  
but at same time believe that either agrees the stance american  
germany wanted demonstrate its independence without be too criticism with israel  
during the upheaval that took place in libya in march of   germany also be conservative when of what that be breadth was of establish a zone of prohibition of flight  
this has been avowed finally by the nato  
 him it difficult to germany adopt a stance clearer when are in game moneyrelated international important  
yes  so is  
this be must to that in these moment is hindrance its policy external  recede of a policy cctv  by so stick  by are states united and focus in a policy external german  
and what that makes yet more are things is that are europeans not have a policy coherent and uniform  
by what therefore  are germans be find in a crossroad  
of them be expects that playing a recreational more independent  but not are familiar to do  
believe that still are tinker constitutes will its role  but already have initiated the road towards a policy external  normal   
a policy external similar to the countries as france or great britain  
 why means specifically a policy external  normal  since the point of sight crystal  
is a policy that  when be about of interests national  be shows unwilling to defend deliberations different to are of states united or their partners europeans  
believe that the policy external german foremost a stronger motivated in the policy economic  is say  in are exports and in their relations with certain regions  as can be russia  china or middle upcoming  
are interests economic germans are until true point different to are of other large powers and by this reason germany must protect their interests  
 these interests economic have unforeseen in the stance adopted with regard at conflict in middle upcoming and in the vote of the un  
by a side  germany account with large markets in middle upcoming  especially in the gulf  
by this reason must be poppy and not alienate of the opinion public arab nor either of are Elite arabs  
this is important  by course  
but myself not him venture discussing importance since that not be about of a relationship totally condone  
without however  yes play a role fundamental in are considerations german  
 has undermined germany its relationship with erroneous  erroneous at abstain of vote in important decisions as in the vote about palestine  
believe that in europe  and even in states united  the stance german appetite of a huge degree of understanding  
by this reason  not believe that be hague produced a breakdown so drastic as in the case of libya  
perhaps with therefore germany hague achieved inquisitor a true respect  
at end and at carried  everything this not has fact but demonstrate that is a country at that tories in seriously as actor international and whose interests there that have in account  
in europe there different opinions beliefs of the initiative palestine  
in change  erroneous  erroneous be has noone clearly to favour of a veto  
 there obstructing of opinions between erroneous  erroneous and many nations european  
always have fresh these disparities due to the policy internal american  
believe that the government of obama shows in secrecy a great understanding towards the position european  
but  to cause of the situation policy that be lives here  is obvious that the government not can defend in public that stance  
believe that the real obstructing of opinions not has in reality the upsurge that be him attaches  
if looking are relations between obama and the firstly minister israeli netanyahu  see that obama not is for nothing enthusiastic with the policy that develops  
 him it difficult to germany reconciling are closer relations that remains with israel and states united  by a side  with the stance of their main partners in the eu  by another  
believe that is precisely why what that ago that pretty so difficult for are germans  
by course that would a little more easy for are germans if sidelined a policy european coherent and homogeneous  but not is the case  
by what therefore  not have the possibility of become part of a creature higher  but that must endeavouring are things since its own position  
why is precisely what that are doing now with the euro  
believe that in the future germany assume a role of leadership to the time of forcing to europe to adopt a stance european  
by course that this not is nothing easy for germany  already pretty simply by the relationship that remains with israel  
this has been always a subject handles  
but believe that are germans have clear that must play the role of obstructed independent  
 be sees germany to yes same in the role of actor international important   wish in reality germany a\xc\xaprincipled a role unchanged  
 or perhaps him continues offputting difficult accept this leadership  
germany yet not be has listening  always it something uneasy and  by reasons obvious  at country him continues costing play a role more important  
if saw the crisis of euro  by example  see that each once that germany be insofar as actor main  be mad certain feelings antialemanes  
this not it easy for are germans  
be about of a old problem and is that nobody wants be surrounded of the countries enemies  
seen of this form  germany be foremost in a position much more difficult that states united  
must show a attitude inclusive debit to are different neighbours and opinions and why not it easy  
the influence of erroneous  erroneous in the policy european decreases each once more  but the eu not covered of moment this vacuum   whom remaining then  
to are germans not them guessing more cureall that a\xc\xaprincipled a role more unchanged  
even if not them likes  if them it distasteful or if them becomes in a people yet more unpopular  c &apos; est the limitations  
pending Szabo is director executive of the academy transatlantic in washington  a institution in the that academics and experts in policy from of europe and of america of north analyse of form jointly are challenges to are that be faces the community transatlantic  
Szabo is addition member of polls marshall polls  where be has specialises in policy german  policy external american and relations transatlantic  
 protection of trademarks  in china  when Puma and armani be verbal of suddenly in trademarks chinese 
armani is a marking wellknown to Echalon global and melts Ralph Lauren also  
but   why is armani melts  
following this behalf be tucked a designation recorded officially in china but that not has nothing that unrelated with are businesses original  
not nevertheless  this appetite of protection while are sufferings epónimos not retabled a demand  
and even then not is clear that be them emphasis to give the reason  
 to are foreigners them it each once more difficult protect their trademarks in china   refers thomas Pattloch  lawyer of founded taylor Wessing specialises in violations of rights of protection in easternmost middle  
each week elegant to my table a new case  
are imitators simply pursued a couple of plate for power costeffective their trademarks  
of this form  Gucci be becomes in Lu-Gucci and in place of Prada be uneven Prada-Kny  
are businesses german also be copied legally of the same way  perhaps and as him has happened at manufacturer of articles sporting Puma  
Pattloch opens a cupboard in the that acceptability seats of the office of trademarks of beijing  
the  of september of  a company china kissinger costeffective the marking Zegna DF Puma  a behalf artificial that also be useless of the home of fashion Ermenegildo Zegna  
that are chinese are champions attempted in why of copying and of violate are rights of property intellectual is of evident known  
in are large cities there large stores of several plants seagoing exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting  
without however  are cases of Pattloch are of negotiator hopes  by bookshop of their customers  him combating against the fact of that the office of trademarks granted of form official to are businesses chinese the right to extremes advantage of a designation that already is recorded in another place  
are chinese what andstates  bang Ming Pai  or marking accompanying  
the prerogative has its origin in the term upshot  bang Dakuan   
that ago reference to women that have  fish  to a man rico  
are authorities chinese not be feel culprits 
 is detrimental for the business  there that fight against therefore   requires Pattloch  
 the marking ago waters  the position monopolistic disappears and the harm that suffering the image is huge   
are losses financial and are shores procedural of are sectors quagmire are grants  about everything in the case of products flagship of luxury  
according data of the company of analysis of market CLSA  with a volume of  million of eur at year china is  in size  the thirdly market of articles of luxury and the that fastestgrowing to greater pace  
without however  achieve the writtenoff of enrolment of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks it complicated and addition supposed much money  
are processes be can prolong until nine years and the outcome is proposal\xe\x\xs  
Pattloch talk of cases in are that the court failed a demand because had appropriations therefore time that the behalf aim of the demand already be had become in a  reality of market   
 if the complainant has etrade fate  perhaps even governing that pay money at plagiador because the process has peloponnese to the marking of giving in china   refers Pattloch  
in occasions this is the law of the jungle  
some of are cases more known have that unrelated with elements gráficos  
in  Daimler-Benz lost a owed against the manufacturer of machinery of construction Sany  the company that has been bridgwater ago little by the manufacturer crystal of bombs of poured Putzmeister  
by why to day of today are chinese can continue using a emblem very similar to the notable of mercedes  
the aseans of volvo  Geely  used at principle a logo in white and blue that cameras in great measure to bmw  the subject be dirimió in are courts and Geely took that change  
the manufacturer of clothes Lacoste lost in china against imitators from of hong hong and singapore whose logo constitutive a crocodile looking in the direction expertise at original  
are authorities chinese not be feel culprits  
the office of trademarks CTMO in beijing comparatively that in  have had difficulties due to the shortage of electronics and staffing of personal  
the year past  without however   the situation of emergency labour returned to the normal   
of this form  the amount of processes of filed without furthermore be has reduced in a    
almost  of these cases be properly solved  a   more that the year previous  
without however   complaints still outstanding of resolution  
fight against this costs much money 
as frequently be preceding in china  are figures are shocking  
the year past the CTMO recorded more of  million of applications of protection of trademarks  almost a third more that in   
be incredibly of a new thanked and means that china leading by tenth year running the list of new enrolment in everything the world  according refers the office of trademarks  
seems that this also happens with the number of logos valid  figure that eur\xc\xa\xc\xabillion to  million in total  
in  be met embolsado  million of cny in concept of rights  
said of negotiator form  this means that of average each alert costs  cny or  eur  
fight against this costs much money  perhaps and as shows the case of the company family german Freudenberg  
since ago more of sevenyear years the group contracted in are courts against a imitador upshot  
if well are germans have managed stopping the manufacture illegal of sourced of car of imitation  
the imitador has achieved check are rights chinese about the marking Freudenberg  
 us ourselves have lessening this situation because in germany are surnames not are protected   refers Hanno Wentzler  president and Consejero councils of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in munich  
the office of trademarks CTMO also failed the resource of are muniqueses  
in are two following forums him have given the reason to Freudenberg  but the part contrary continues fronts in the currently  
there that have extremely childcare 
now the case has reached to are doors of court higher of justice  where continues overdue of resolution  
Wentzler feels in power untangled russias the issue and heralded the professionalising of are courts  
without however  also claims that  the procedure is extremely costly  therefore in terms of money as of time   
it difficult estimate are costs internal  the inquiries entrepreneurial has had that review dossiers of until sterling years of progressed for power clarified tests  
ago five years Freudenberg promised to the part contrary a  sum of six figures in eur  with the objective of get to a agreement amicable  but not took success  
 this shows what much that us brushed   refers Wentzler  
are dangers that creeping in easternmost middle enforced even with affect to europe  
specifically if are imitators be assure there are rights about trademarks not logically  
so  a manufacturer upshot lineup costeffective in germany the behalf Freudenberg for shoes and products of fur  
ago time that the group chairman this area commercial  not nevertheless crane prevent the alert  
 there that have extremely childcare   claims Wentzler  
therefore him as the lawyer Pattloch assignment to are businesses german that provided desperately exiting to the time of make turnover with china  
not enough with corporate in the legislation international about rights of marking  but that what that there that make is  costeffective also in china everything defaults that can be simulation of protection   perhaps and as suggests Wentzler  
of what opposite  the subject can comparative much more expensive that a simple registration  
of fact  in case of that Freudenberg diminish the finally provoked of its battle particular  then would that pay to the part contrary rights of licence by its own behalf  perhaps and as explained Wentzler  
why or in the bracket in issue us expulsarían of market

and if we in account that the man of greater age indicate matches  years  seems that the age of Müslümov is quite alienated  
 born in the region in  and died in    us explained Fatulayeva  
the man focus married in three occasions and took  children  at apparently still took time of parliamentarians a daughter more to the age of  years  
 be has wrong then Şirali Müslümov in its age in a couple of decades  
without however  Rembrandt fibre  gerontólogo in the institute charisma Planck of rostock  also has heard speak of the older age of this inhabitant of asia central

due to the lack of hypothetical  it impossible clarified tests scientific beliefs of the age  details when either there any registration civil  
all are days dominate full of butter derretida 
is a fact that  of form disconcertingly prevalent  are inhabitants of the region located in around to Lerik noneuro sacrifices a age biblical  
in the currently there  people that considerably are  years of age  
 by why live here  in the southern  many people of age older  
the guide tourist azerí Farid Mugimzadeh explained that be about of are genes excise of are talyshis  
the authorised of museum  the mrs Fatulayeva  believes in change that the cause lie in the meal  
without however  since a point of sight nutritional  not seems familiar that precisely the meal richer in calories of are talyshi  that assertions the meat  the bread and about everything are products dairy and many of are wish  addition  drink commuters a glass of butter derretida  pretty so formulating  
 or perhaps pretty the form of life natural the that remains to the people youngest  in Cengemiran  a slight settlement not far of the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva

are tooth of Mirzayeva are whites and are perfectly premises and under the confusingly tucked two lots trenzas of nose yellow montenegrin that its son us discover proud  
always me i brainwashed the nose with milk  by why never be me has fallen and has backing its colour  
 either i used never a chemically   claims Mirzayeva  
the pension is sufficient for live 
of always has admittedly just what that originally in its own farm  tomatoes  potatoes and peas  
in whole my life not i gone never to make the communitywide to a supermarket  
then us talk of its husband  that focus in the army  
what worse was the era subsequent to the second war global  
without however  everything returned to its things when the  wanted father   Heydar Aliyew  took the control of the situation  
this type of propaganda sounds bizarre in mouth of a woman greater

Mirzayeva offered  manat  approximately the same amount in eur  in concept of pension monthly  a amount with the that be can live well bearing in account the situation here  
and perhaps the canoso son of Mirzayeva governing reason   in our culture are elderly are very physics

as if this not outside reason sufficient for frontrunners with life many years  
in the constitution lack the expression  rights human  
the epochal has circle at cairo  
demonstrations that vying between yes in the cairo gm of highlighted the tremendous division in the that is desperately the country  
the relates constitution  with the sharia as basis  it very recycled  
the president egyptian not indulge in patetismo  
 must overcome the transition  
and that why occurring is my responsibility  before the people and before god   stated in the television public  
its speech going focused to everything the people  about everything to are copts christians  are liberals  are muslims ilustrados and are secular  
all them  cope without cureall until now in a confused opposition  have scared  
scared of a theocracy to shores of kordofan by the grace of the powerful community muslims  
perhaps and as explained jinnah Mursi  almost asking assemblies  has had that withdrawn of form temporary are competences of court constitutional and enlarging are scuppering  for power save the epochal   
without however  nor are egyptians nor the world whole know very well what that this engineer of  years with a title of phd orientates by the university of southern of california wants save really  
 intended depriving of its power to the judiciary  
of fact  are  articles  whose approval has been witnesses by a assembly chines association by  member predominantly islamists in a meeting nights of  hours of duration  are truly worrying  
as in previous constitutions  in the draft also be says that the cater be based in are  principles of right islamic   
without however   why means why of  principles   
this was and continues indictors open to the interpretation and seems that are islamists going to spheres this vague formulation  so as the margin of manoeuvre legal that leads attached  for impose a interpretation more stringent of the sharia  
this is at least what that implication a new article added  in all are issues relating to the sharia is obligatory consultation to the university Al-Ashar  the institution islamic more important of country with a great power in everything the islamism sunni  
not has by why be so  but this can legitimate that the clerics controlaría the legislation  something that  of fact  would as outcome the incapacity of the judiciary  
great part of draft of the constitution is open to the interpretation 
what that also it uncharted is that intended maintain the jurisdiction military  
during the dictatorship of alis these courts fallacious for exert a heavyhanded repression about the opposition  
following the flakes of dictator until  civilians be sick detainees in alianza military  
perhaps and as cast the draft  the state has of protect  the real essence of the oneworld egyptian  and  reckon its morals and their values   
be about of a formulation so formulation in terms legal that with the aid of this article are institutions state could even monitor are content of the lawful and the literature  
talking clear not be about of negotiator certainty that of censorship  
by true that any article cast of form explicitly the equality between men and women  
in change another prohibits offend or slandering at prophet jinnah and to their legacies  
without however  not remaining clear why is a offence and how has of be sanctioned  
equally of dubious is the formulation that prohibits the  offence to are people  
 is sufficient a cartoon of president or a joke about a letrado  
issue of interpretation  as many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Mursi for its signature and that according  their succinctly   very soon  will submitted to are egyptians for be referred to referendum  
 the epochal has journey  
ago weeks that the opposition is closing queues debit to the superiority of are islamists  
ten billion people be met in a unusual harmony in the afternoon of friday in the square tahrir of Cario and juraron make unstuck the acta before of that can enter in force  
 the epochal has circle and finished defeating   claims Hamdin Sabbahi  that breed the thirdly place in are lists to are elections presidential  
the nobel of the peace and exdirector of body international of energy atomic  mohammed El-Baradei  declared that the draft of the constitution should be  in the dustbin of the junkfood of the history   
to via of twitter unauthorised to are followers of Mursi of loved hitherto a  coup of state against the democracy   
 when nld the referendum predominantly to its palace and what derrocaremos   claims the maracaibo Jasser Said  
 yet not are tired  the blood of our brotherhood yet not has been expiada   be base in are media egyptians at political maracaibo Chaled nationwide  
and several judges improvements that not voices monitor the referendum  by what that not be call valid  
 the koran is our constitution  
by its part  the community muslims well organised cooperative a appeal for highranking a contramanifestación  by if developing not in the square tahrir  but following a sentence at another side of kordofan  before the university of the cairo  
many women implies with a sweep and supporters of are salafistas took part in the same at cry of   the people requires the application of the law divine   
today\xe\x\xs to Mursi  rubbish the country   at same time that proclamaban   the koran is our constitution   
a combating by the sovereignty of the symbolism square tahrir  where started everything  had lessening a situation similar to the of a war civil  
is obvious that are supporters of Mursi not wanted significance to that something so drafted  
are brotherhood muslims no\xc\xaone that therefore are that be oppose at draft of the constitution as are supporters of same met expressed their opinions high and clear  
now would reached the moment of stop that the people got in are ballot why direction should continue the country  
in this sense  seems that the draft of are islamists has covering the majority  
 the expression &apos; rights human &apos; nor even permeating  
hafez mazen Saeda is blokland with this process constitutional forced that in reality should have maoists until february and have provoke to all are forces social  
this lawyer of  years specialises in rights human and president of the organisation egyptian of rights human  EOHR  stuck to are brotherhood muslims when be sick internationals in prison or confronted that make debit to a trial during the dictatorship of alis  
not because compartiera its ideology  but because for him are rights human are indivisible  
by this reason was mercilessly  condemned and incarcerated  
 and now the expression `Derechos human &apos; nor even permeating in the new constitution   be regrets in a conversation with the newspaper  majdanek pan Sonntag   
the enlargement of are competences of Mursi to are three powers of state cooperative that this lawyer be resignara  
are measures actions are gross violations of are rules of game democratic and fruition to egypt to a new dictatorship  
 in place of strengthen the society civil  what that has fact the president is abolirla   be regrets Saeda  
without however  the democracy not can functioned without are organisations of the society civil  
Saeda be feel abandoned  also by the community international  the which noticeable the combating ideologically that is bearing place to shores of kordofan with a mixture of puberty and tension  
this could backfire in its against

the rakfisk is trucha in delicious that be leaves fermentar in water during  depending of what maloliente that you what cooperating  until a year

the rakfisk is a product that comes of a era very different  in the that the poverty azotaba norway and in the that  before of that sidelined the cooling  the fish be bore during the autumn turmoil in water and salt in barrels herméticos

my crisis of identity mexicano-estadounidense 
claims that many be saw forced to abandon mexico due to the lack of opportunities 
are mexicans frequency to criticise to are that be were  says that recollection to are mexicans of those times match 
Navarrette observing that are mexicano-estadounidenses be find trapped between two worlds  
in a recent journey to city of mexico  barely had gone by the absurdly and reached to the zone of processing of immigration and already was totally muddled  
few notices yearend the road towards two queues  a for  mexicans  and negotiator for  foreigners   
me amazed there few seconds without be sure towards where prior go  
at have grown in california central  during whole my life me have struck  mexican   
be about of taquigrafía cleansing  of same way in that my friends of boston be nos to yes ourselves as  irish  or my friends of new york be described to yes ourselves  italian   
more afternoon me chose by  mexicano-estadounidense   
but this was mexico  
and  in the fatherland of my grandfathers  the taquigrafía or are scenarios not were necessary  
simply was american  
relationships spanish  what enough well as for manejarme during a interview in this language  
but not i the Echalon of vocabulary of a greeks and not afraid deshacerme of my accent american  
so that parliament\xe\x\xs my passport american and me contacted in the queuing of foreigners  
thought in who moment of this week in the that the president servants of mexico  casas Peña grandson  visited the home white for meet with the president obama  
in the agenda of day  as always that be chanting are leaders of these two countries  mccartin  immigration  drugs and trade  
Peña grandson was hearing speak also of growth of the economy mexican  a of are reasons by are that in these moment is so likely that a mexican be please in mexico as that be unwanted to go to are states united  
wants unreliability with states united and canada and create in alert a bloc commercial at lifestyle of the union european  
addition  Peña grandson promised continue fighting against are cartels of the drug in mexico  although not gave devil  
for mexico  the relationship with are states united is predicament and is full of grudge  
probably the majority of americans never be remember of that in  are states united corroborated mexico and neglect to their leaders to required the halved of its territory to correcting of correcting  
but for are mexicans  that considerably in centuries  not in fiveminute  are elements that be what recollection are by all parts  
so that  in the moment in the that a servant of are states united says any certainty that charter the more minimum criticism to mexico  starter to hear complaints  therefore in the press as between the elite nd  about how are americans are usurpando the sovereignty of their neighbours  
and are children of Moctezuma be gm in ordinary of war  
and yet so  for mexico  the relationship that really supposed everything a challenge is the that have with are more of  million of mexicano-estadounidenses that live in are states united  
 talk of grudge  
there much  
in mexico there winners and losers  people for are that the country diverse opportunities and other for are that not is so  
the single reason by the that there many people of yugoslavias mexican abject in cities as are angeles  are casino  phoenix  denver or san antonio is that  in some point of our tree genealógico  tribunal a person  can that the father or the mother or conceals of are grandparents  to the that be him emphasise the door of are opportunities in mexico and took that duke towards the north  
and the majority of are sometimes reorganizing person cumbersome in a profile operating  fur darker  a Echalon of studies under  uninterested of a people poorest  etc 
us are their topdown and them are loyal  
to mexico not  
and  to despite of that perhaps we abject now the dream american  at have gone to neighbourly schools and have had good jobs  not cannot lose never of sight that what that are abject is why  the dream american  and not the mexican  
is possible that to sometimes our identity not actually clearer  but our loyalty yes that what is  
is for are states united  
addition  are conscious of that to many of are mexicans detain to the elite of the class leading not them gustamos  
the feeling is mutual  
us supposing as a reminder of a defeat humiliating and us starts by above of shoulders as if immovable of a category lower that not is what enough mexican  
our spanish never will what enough healthpromoting and our ties with mexico never will what enough participant  
to its way of unrelated  our existence is synonymous of failure  
if our families not innocents failed in mexico  not be innocents gone  
and now not us effort trapped following this smokescreen of wrap  abject well in are states united but  yet so  as souls solitarias  
my woman  that born in guadalajara and wine legally to are states united when was a girl  me reminds that there this roce between are mexicans and are mexicano-estadounidenses because are first know with more greeces govern are and to are seconds this them \xe\x\xder  
although is citizens of are states united  she be believes part of are two countries  
while therefore  many mexicano-estadounidenses that know feel that not are part of none of are two  
us love listen at group mexican are tigers of north  but also to Bruce Springsteen  
viewpoints what better of each country  but not getting deeprooted to none of them  
in mexico us supposing as americans  
and in are states united be us believes mexicans  
now  for overcomplicating yet more are things  by what that me i news during my journey  some leaders mexicans and some intellectuals want return to reconnecting with the diaspora  
want that are mexicano-estadounidenses motif as  ambassadors  of mexico improvised  turmes their interests in are states united  
\xe\x\xunmanageable\xe\x\x to our colleagues americans what fantastic that is visiting this country and presionaríamos to are leaders politicians for that reforzaran their ties with mexico  
yes  clear  
why not going to pass  
there too grudge  
and  with the inequality of wages  the corruption endemic and the violence by drugs  many of us not are so insurance of that pretty a country fantastic  
me afraid that pioneering \xe\x\xhungarians to happen concert with this idea  friends  
is fair  
if some mexicans yet not are enhancing for eager to are states united by the form in the that protestors to mexico ago a century and half  then have that accept the fact of that some mexicano-estadounidenses yet absolute begrudgers by how be contacted to their relatives ago extremely least time  
Hmmm  
perhaps let more  mexicans  of what that abundantly  
productive battles  new middle half 
the high the ceasefire between israel and hamas well could be a basis little likely for the peace 
 able have some day a peace lasting between arabs and jews in middle half  
another bloodshed of blood that seems indicate that any expectancy is in vain  
in half of are idle and arise discussions about whom schoolteacher first  effluent of buildings have stranded accessing to bricks  more of  palestinians  the majority of them civilians  and six israelis have been murdered and  by first once  missiles from of gaza have fallen pipe of aviv aviv  the deservedly of israel  and the city holy of jerusalem  
but  to despite of that are israelis and are palestinians seem be communitybased in its former conflict  everything regard them surrounds in middle half is changing  
the spring arab what has longer everything fact extremity them propriety or not  palestinians and israelis have stranded trapped in the mighty regional  
perhaps this ultimate that its combating pretty yet more bloodiest that before  
without however  there reasons for thinking that its antihuman situation of point deadlock could desencallarse  
a war that nor be stays nor be earns 
to first sight  the optimism seems currently very difficult of justify  
even if be remains the high the ceasefire agreed the  of november  are clashes of this week have reinforced to are hawks of both sides  
are leaders of hamas  the movement islamist that has ruled gaza since   contend have justifiable to are israelis to withdrawing  to despite of that gaza has received a good fossils  
and to despite of have fattened to some of their leaders and ran to pressure to are  million of inhabitants of gaza in one of are corners more squalid and middlesized of planet  israel not has able end with hamas  
of fact  hamas is gaining ground in west  the negotiator part of palestine currently centreright by their implacable rival of fatah  the facción palestine more moderate  
addition  are leaders of hamas could get to the conclusion of that the time unstable to its favour  
given that are islamists have gone gaining influence by everything the world arab  hamas has fact extra widening and powerful  
turkey  a renaciente power regional that previously had been the organisation\xe\x\xs muslim more practicable to israel  has espoused the cause of hamas  also what has fact qatar  one of are states more rich and dynamic of gulf  
are exultantes member of hamas say that the average moon islamist is bishops israel  since the lebanon at north  where predominates the partido-milicia Hizbulá  passes by syria  where are rebels of a trend each once more islamist could overthrow to abdullah assad  until get to jordan  where are allies of hamas are threatening at king  
about everything in the flank southern of israel  the growth of are brotherhood muslims targeted by the president Muhammad Morsi in egypt  with difference the more populated and fundamental of are countries arabs  has reshaped the balance of the region  
hosni alis  the despot secular that revitalised in egypt during  years until its nemeses in   not took too time for hamas  
in change  are brotherhood muslims are primos brotherhood of hamas and their leaders depend more of the opinion popular  
in future actions outrages  is possible that hamas legitimation as unchanged at that not be can exclude  nor even israel and are states united  
while therefore  the wings heavyhanded of israel find the conclusion contrary  
in what that be concerns the issue military  have since to hamas in its website  
the system ballistic Cúpula of iron of israel has shown its efficiency and many of are missiles of hamas have been destroyed  
are israelis dormirán more dreaded  during some time  
in regard to the diplomacy  states united be shows more firm that never  many countries europeans also culparon to hamas of have initiated the latest wave of violence  
before everything  israel has prosperous  especially under the government of benjamin netanyahu  a firstly minister that has ignoring widely the process of peace  
although are everythingnot abbass since gaza have host with the life of few  israelis since   israel not has had too terrorists bombers  in part thank to the barrier that corrodes west  the main prioritise of a territory oars to become in state of palestine  and protects are settlements jews that still mount to despite of that  according the legislation international  provided illegal  
the mr netanyahu  whose party likud be has uk to a group of a online yet more heavyhanded led by Avigdor Lieberman in the period runup to are elections the  of january  is in a good position  
 by why mimar to these retorcidos palestinians thanking a state own  
if really gobernaran in west   not dispararían everythingnot perhaps and as have fact its compatriots in gaza  
is better taken following this wall and give a good coup if rose the head  
perhaps be endeavour the wings heavyhanded  although the spring arab could interruptions their somewhere  
although are islamists that enterprises the power in egypt and in others websites not conclude too aloft to israel  its priority will tackle are difficulties internal  
the budget of defence of israel is greater that the of their four neighbours arabs together  
initiate a war with the superpower of the zone citing indiapakistan to are new governments arabs to improve their economies  
that the pragmatic mr Morsi hague worked with obamas obama for achieve the high the ceasefire is a good bodes and could adhered the beginning of something  
also are israelis should thinking to long longterm  
with the rest of world arab inventive more democratic  depriving to are palestinians of its right to the selfdetermination supposed create a erupt that a day explotará in are territories occupied by israel  of the same form that this week exploded a bus in aviv aviv  
the repression already is competitivity the democracy in the state jewish and the demography graver the situation to measure that casualty the population arab  
are cruentas missions against gaza each two or three years for reject to hamas salaries a toll seriousness each once greater  
both sides estonia a push of people foreign at conflict  
the solution continues remains the that pregonan people sensible of both sides  the majority of world external and this newspaper  two states and the vested of territory by part of israel by reasons of security  
the expectancy  small to shortterm longterm  is that the high the ceasefire advise a little more of impetus to are people foreign that are fighting by this cause  
egypt  that must start to put curb to the entry of weapons in gaza  along with turkey and qatar  be foremost in a situation without unprecedented for convince to hamas of that accepted the idea of a state jewish based in are borders of   with removing of earth and a jerusalem shared  
are arabs misinformation at subject also should pressure to hamas and fatah for that be join  
why compliance more to the creation of a state palestinian that the \xc\xabn attempt of obtain a category of state cyberspace in the un  
the mr obama also has a important role in what that concerned to achieve carry to israel to the table of negotiation  
during its firstly mandate tailing tabling its own plan for the peace  
of new in the home white  seems equally of reticent to fact its attention  
this attitude supposed a microcredit vision of future  
a middle half stable is of vital interest for are states united  
this secondreading a agreement of peace between israel and palestine

during are greetings of day of action of thank of this year  of form unexpected had that pass five hours in a airport because the aeroplane in the that volábamos suffered a problem electronics and had that wait to that equities another aeroplane  
so that had extremely time for thinking in the boredom  
not pioneering shall to stoop  
Pasarse half day in a airport waiting to that comes a flight is quite boring  even if viewpoints media for be dawdled  as books  journals or iPhones  without forget of are tents duty-free  
but each once there more academics and experts in development infant that praising are blessings of boredom  
according them  is well that  therefore us as our children  us aburramos of once in when  
dull binds at brain to seek options interesting and can that emphasizing the creativity  
given that  currently  the majority of us are connected to this or to reorganizing screen  not moments are profits that contributing the boredom  
so that   should accept of good mood the boredom  
yes  
and not  
but  already discuss of therefore more later

 of fact  the history of boredom is very exhaustive   claims

 the problem is that already be has defined and discussed of very various shapes   acceptability john d Eastwood  professor of Psicología of the university of york in Ontario  canada  
following examine are investigations constantly and avenues the idea before a group of discussion adhoc by  people  the professor Eastwood and their colleagues advancing the boredom as the experience of  desired  but not power  participate in a activity that fee full   
claims that the difference between the boredom and the apathy is that the person not ago something but wants do  
refers that with the apathy not there the desire of make something  
the experience main of boredom  claims  is  the breakdown of process of attention  aches to a under state of mood and to a feeling of that the time passes closeness   
the boredom can sounded indignant reappear to the depression  
without however  the professor Eastwood says that  although able be asserting  are people that are aburridas frequency to unrelated the problem as a issue of environment or of world  while that are people that are deprimidas feel that the problem what have them  
to sometimes believe that are boring  when what that us occurs in reality is that we problems for concentrating

 by another side  when getting doing something boring  as undetectable sourced unprepared in a online of manufacture  a music that fee distraiga fee can help to not aburrirte

 are investigations demonstrate that those children to are that be them allows stuck learn more and forged more information that those to are that be them binds to be static   claims the professor Fenske  
all know what that is dull in some moment  the delay of a aeroplane  a speaker monótono  a film especially aburrida  
but some people have more trend to dull that other  
for help to medirlo  some researchers proceeded in are years  a  scale of trend at boredom   
the scale includes issues as  many of are things that i that make are endlessly and monótonas  and  there many things that me eulevel that not i time of do everything   
pending Vodanovich  professor of Psicología of the university of snails florida  claims that  using councils levels  are researchers have discovered that are nauseating have more trend to dull more to often that are weightcontrol  and specifically estonia more stipulation roadmap and more diverse  
but  in general  are adolescents are a type of group that be boring with quite easily  
in   Reed Larson  professor of development humankind and img of the university of illinois  reappraisal to carried a experiment in the that be disposal in contact with  adolescents and with their parents between sevenyear and eightpoint sometimes at day through a search  
found that the  by cent of are adolescents starve that be aburría while was in the school or doing are homework  while that the  by cent starve that be aburría when not was in the school  
by another side  the  by cent of are parents saying that be aburrían  
the professor Larson said that not knew if are percentages of boredom current   years after  would middlemanagement or upper  
but said that what that yes knew was that  the adolescence is a period in the that the boredom portugal\xe\x\xs its correctness more highest   in great part due to that therefore to are children as to are adolescents not be them gives a great control about what that want make  
so that  leave to my question of principle   is healthpromoting dull  
to sometimes not what is  already that  fight at easternmost  can make that us negligence to risks physical unproductive  as make casino or selfexplanatory in the consumption of substances as method for combated  perhaps and as demonstrate are investigations  
by another side  many philosophers and writers talk of the connection between the boredom and the creativity  according claims the professor Vodanovich  that has state departments this issue during more of two decades  
 the boredom is the way that has the brain of advice that take be doing negotiator certainty   says garry Marcus  professor of Psicología of the university of new york  
but the brain not always knows why is what more indispensible  
if getting boring and colourful that energy for touch the guitarra or cook  why fee corrie  
but if categorized the television  is possible that fee addresses to shortterm longterm  but not to long longterm  
 so that  if hostagetaking son is boring and him feed a ipad  is possible that already not be aburra  but not will learnt to sanitary by yes same or to dosificarse   claims the professor Fenske  
and  that capacity of dosificarse be applies to other situations   refers  
hostagetaking son not only afterwards to sanitary by yes only  but that afterwards to supervised better in other fields  
not believe that really reinforce impressed the boredom  
but either should be too critics with him  
our objective should be  more well  the of satisfaction comfortable seq of rumour everwidening of are activities and are technologies  
the professor Eastwood is of agreement  
 to our way of unrelated  need aburrirnos more  but the boredom is a desire too olympia and disturbing as for dedicated with something that deserves the penalty   claims  
refers that what that the people really search is a way of disconnect and of enjoy of a time deadlock  
 in a environment in the that are constantly sobreestimulados   claims   is difficult find forms of spotlight our attention when the fuss disregarding   
colorado  without book of instructions for the new law about the consumption of marijuana 
anthony Orozco  student of  years in a institute img and exalting of southeast of colorado  be faces to a process outwith by something that soon will legal in everything the state  the possession of pursued stones of marijuana and a pipa that used for fumarla  
Orozco says that a day of september  him and some friends billboards by Lamar  in are plains registrars to the border of kansas  when are stop the police  
the police found marijuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a induced judiciary by possession of drugs and articles asserting  crimes minors that entail each one a fined of  dollars americans  in the that be him \xe\x\xit of the date of trial  
 us trying as to criminals   says Orozco  
 and what are  
in are weeks of uncertainty following to the vote that took place in colorado for the legalising of the tenure of small quantities of marijuana for use recreational  the response in hundreds of causes minors by tenure of drugs depends least of the law that of the enterprise\xe\x\xs  
hundreds of crimes minors by possession of marijuana be are overwritten therefore here as in the state of washington  where be adopted a measure similar  
are departments of police have longer of tabling charges against are elderly of  years by possession to small scale  that be assure legally a once the law hague enters in force in are forthcoming weeks  
but are prosecutors of districts more conservatives of colorado be have committed to continue later with are cases open by possession of marijuana and still are statement to people  
at same time  several cities  since are suburbs of denver until are mountains western  are voting for prevent that be contact tents of marijuana  approves recently  in their communities  
 everything this is changing so rapidly that not know why will what follows   said daniel donnelly Oates  head of police in Aurora  fair at this of denver  
those be employees of are unhealthy in the state of washington also are dwelling dwelling at subject  
and still quest advice for establish a system of licensing of production  manufacture  distribution and sale  everything therefore before of that comes the date limit  the  of december of   
say that  for well or for evil  colorado going by ahead of the majority of are states in regard to the strides of use of the marijuana  first with purposes terapeúticos and now for use recreational  
 colorado disposal of a market more regulated  so that will a good guide   claims brian and smith  spokesman of the commission of control of alcohol of state of washington  
but the mr smith derogations that any place or system only can make suggestions about what that could functioned  
 not there a lipservice precedent that us serve of model   claims  
the law of washington  socalled identified  enters in force the  of december  what that leaves also a year during the which be nadará between two waters  already that the system of licensing in this state yet not willingness  but the possession will legal  
addition  there some issues mechanical trickier that must disputes during this period  as the way of maintain a balance between the reexamined of state of offer a  access adequate  to the marijuana authoritative and its prohibition of make turnover of cannabis in a radius lower to  metres of schools  parks  areas of game childrens or polands childrens  
 in any place publics more difficult heysel a business of cannabis solomon that in are areas urban  especially in the area heavy of seattle   says ben Livingston  spokesman of centre for the cannabis legal  a group of research caucus recently  
the  of november  Oates  the head of police of Aurora  sent a email ecommerce to their agents of police in the that them \xe\x\xit of that the prosecutor of the city discard of prevail actions judicial by untruths convict by possession of marijuana to people elderly of  years and of that the police discard of tabling charges against these crimes  with effect immediate   
the head of police Oates said that them be away of make comply the regulation of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana with purposes therapeutically and that relocate persecute to traffickers and sellers of drug  
in the county of Weld  in the north of colorado  the prosecutor of district  esteem Buck  represents a vision more stringent  
following the vote  assured that its office annihilation persecute are cases of possession of marijuana  mainly for pressure to are consumers and that be operations to receiving treatment  
currently   people be face to charges by possession of  grams or least of marijuana  although many of them have others charges  
 our office has the obligation of prevail actions judicial against throughout untruths that in the moment in that be were were crime   said the mr Buck in a declaration  
the response has been predicament even in places as the county rural of table  where are voters rejected the initiative about the legalising of the marijuana  
the police of finishing Junction  the greater city of county  already not quotation to adults by possession of small quantities  
Pete Hautzinger  prosecutor of district of county  supported this decision  but also decided not underestimating none of are cases outstanding by possession  
 not believe that actually losing the time at continue doing comply the law until that this changes   stated  
to despite of that the  by cent of are voters supported the measure  never be seen that carry the consumption of marijuana for use recreational at likud of government and of system judiciary outside to be easy  
are reactions odds that arise by everything the state gm of highlighted a transportation ambivalence between are officials regard of great experiment dumont in this state  
 be about of a barrier cultural with are prosecutors of district   claims provided McAllister  a lawyer of denver that represents to are accused by possession of marijuana and that is spokesman local of the organisation national for the reform of the law about the marijuana

at be are first states that feel are quantities small of marijuana of the same way that if outside alcohol  colorado and washington be generals for become in are cases of proof to Echalon national in regard to the legalising of drugs  
while lawyers and officials of state delegates with a new border of sales legal  also awaiting eagerly receiving complied of government federal  that yet envisages the consideration of the sale and the cultivation of marijuana as crimes umbrella  
are defenders of the legalising of the marijuana have the expectancy of that the department of justice exerted  
to despite of that be have produced some lips arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for purposes therapeutically  the government federal has permitted in its majority that maybe turnover of sale of marijuana with these purposes in colorado  washington and  states more

can apparently improbable that these ezra provided part of a oneminute of youngsters of menta  but to despite of why  or perhaps due to why  the webstreaming be returned viral in gUnther in singapore to principles of this year  
are quoting are part of a rap that uses references local as  going to put a bao  bollo  in the oven  for laughing of the rate of birth of singapore  
the company of advertising that cooperative the webstreaming  BBH  participating the expectancy of that with the oneminute twostate draw the attention about the problem of a way amusing  
its director creative  Douglas Hamilton  says that consequently wielding the power of the music for that the people observance with  its duty national   
this is something purely of internet  so that had that do fun and ridiculous  
is the greater problem in this country  
are are worst of world in reproducirnos to us ourselves  so that verge that this was a subject that vindicated that tackle  
knew that the government had tried many things  as launch perfumes with feromonas or organise veladas of quotations quick  speed-dating   
many of these ideas can have been creative  but not necessarily polling  
so that stick   by why not doing what more creative possible for environments this problem  that is remind a rap  
 children 
the that not be what decisionmaking so to the lightly is the government of singapore  
guardia US   at year in policies for encourage to are citizens to have more children  
a package of government for peopletrafficking and parents conferred until  dollars by child  stretches are licensing by maternity and diagnosed profits prosecutors  
but everything this has had little effect  
singapore is a city state richer and of fatality technology in the southeast of asia  also wellknown by the conservatism of their rulers and their stave controls social  
the rate of birth of singapore  of agreement with its division national of population  be ranked currently in  children by woman  
the latest once that focus by above of  wellknown as rate of reposición- was in   
so that  by why are singapurenses not have more children  
so jingsheng Ming  authorised of policies of marriage and oneworld of the division national of population  says that is due to a  better education  and  a range more wider of opportunities of career   
 why him has permitted to the people truly of a range more wider of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities  more beyond of intrigued and become a oneworld   explained  
these changes in are standards social have contributed at increase of the soltería  and to deploying the marriage and are challenged  what that gives as outcome a drop of the rate of birth in singapore  
while therefore  a policy of immigration eu correcting to increase drastically the immigration for reacting debit to the drop of the population has caucus umbrage between the population local  
in singapore there websites website where rife the xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants  in particular are chinese  to are that criticised by maintain are wages netherlands and not integrated  
the increase of the immigration also is seen as a of are reasons by are that the year past the party of government of singapore underwent its worse outcome electoral since the independence  
since are elections has there a attempt of correct the problem  with are quotas and taxes more highest for are workers foreigners  
consequences unexpected 
while that the nemeses in the rate of birth has effects known in the growth economic of a nation  are income prosecutors  are costs health and are policies of immigration  the example of singapore also is bearing some consequences unexpected  
the government attempts that not be motorways many houses small  
by example  has started to affect at sector timeshare  
the authority of development urban has past to monitor the number of apartments smaller  known as  box of shoes   that be able build in certain areas of the city  
these apartments have rooms of  metres square and have had much success of sales  
without however  there concern of that able reckon a lifestyle of life of soltería and desanimen to are developers that organize build houses large  relatives  
but Lim Yew chee  director general of the company belgians the Developers  says that their  boxes of shoes  be dumped much more faster that are units more large  
are more popular  in the sense of that are units be deplete days  even weeks  more faster that are units of greater size  
this ago that pretty much better for our flow of box  
without however  derogations that are new standards give chairpersons more unclear for are developers  to are that before be them disposal snags if wanted offer busy units small in a project  
too estresados 
singapore is a city state  
if well these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the rate of birth national  at speak with are singapurenses that working in the district financial of centre prompt that not going to have much effect  
 the people is very estresada  are houses are coin and also what is the education  by what that many people what are postponing   says a youngest executive  
other people can have children  
 but for me is important envisage with my own money and time   says another youngest of few  years  
men and women gs its career  the civilisationrelated and the eurozone of are properties and of the education as are reasons that them prevent have children  
so that  by much that the government treated of oppress to their citizens to have children  when be about of make payers  are singapurenses are those have the latest prerogative

correas  that took in the saw summit presidential of the union of nations Suramericanas  unasur   aired in lima  declared to the statebased broadcasters peru that are europeans  be sabena in the second war global  and in others conflicts   but now are practically a fatherland   
stuck  in this sense  the project of establish the citizenship suramericana that prospect are countries member of the unasur  
 there that achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers by any country suramericano  as already happens with are agreed of the community andean  but still there sectors bandar that us want back at past   warned  
the president betancourt be reversed  addition  to favour of the euroinfocentres of the organisation of states americans  OEA  under the premise of overproduction the influence of are states anglosaxon and have in account to are that have cosignatories the pacts of san josE about are rights human  
are that give contested never be committing to nothing and  in change  us are suramericanos what attendance everything  
 is incomprehensible that the commission interamerican of rights human actually in washington under the funding of states united   stated in box at asylum political given by correas at founder of wikileaks  julian assange  
correas assured that not is arrepentido of that decision because with therefore not has betrayed their principles  but that has disregarded their  profound values corresponding and of rights human   
levelled that  in its moment   had suspicions degrading of that assange outside extradited to a thirdly country and not be respect its process   
criticized  addition  to the justice swedish by geographically that be put in its territory at interrogation by a alleged crime sexual when  the own legislation swedish allows carry through videoconferencing  that be could make since the embassy of correas in london

 not i spoken with him since that is in our embassy  but the ambassador me informed that wasnt a slight problem pulmonar  nothing severe   said the callback betancourt  
what that yes there is the danger of that be deteriorate its health physical and mental by be confinement in a space slight without power make occasional at air free  
 why complicates the health of any person   levelled

us not concessions with rights human  that prerogative not the therapeutically in this case  but has there settingup talks  
 the solution of this problem is in hands of great britain  sweden and of are authorities legal european because the lawyer of assange  Baltazar baltasar  is doing a series of procedures in different forums european   professor  
and opinion that  if great britain gives morning the convince this be just   
and if sweden  as perfectly what allows its legislation and as has fact in others cases  interroga at mr assange in the embassy of correas in london or what interroga fasttrack Skype morning same be just this problem  
correas occasion for assert as a proponent of the freedom of press and matizó that what that not crumbling is  the mediocrity  the etrade faith and the silly  that weaken the freedom of expression   
 are elderly enemies of the freedom of press not are are politicians villains and grievously but are bad journalists in function of appetites  the ransom and the extortion   said  
in this aspect be welcomed that already not provided these journalists  nor are bankers nor are countries hegemonic and burgueses are that corporations to correas   and anticipated that of be reappointed  requests in the epochal for continue the road and the direction accurate   
correas also supported the decision of maintain the veto to paraguay in the unasur at least until their forthcoming elections  at continuously that the body  must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the golpismo fraught of legality  because in reality  catastrophe the legitimacy of the democracy paraguaya   
the president betancourt seen  addition   perfectly irrelevant  the desire of its counterpart colombian  juan manuel ends  of particulars now with nicaragua are limits relates between both countries following the ruling of the accountable international of justice of the hague  that sucrose to the sovereignty maritime nicaragüense  
by the moment not be playing this ruling  
is a problem between a country facilitates and one centroamericano  
are conflicts are inevitable  but must be overcome by the goodwill of threw together  
there that enables of form wider for overcome and continue later  
also wellbalanced in a good conclusion of kargil by limits relates that hushed in the same court peru and chile and opinion that  is adjudicate for america latin seek forums international if are two countries be committing to accept ruling by hard that pretty   
in reference to the eventuality that be present as contender in are forthcoming elections presidential in correas for seek a thirdly mandate running migrant that sees that possibility  with much optimism and joy  although to sometimes is quite hard   
correas assured that if stays are beginnings of february of  be withdrawn of the life public  
in what personal never me has interested the power  but in situations so unjust as the of correas that poverty socioeconomic only be can correct since the power political  
 my movement pólitico costfree that was myself anyone defaults that likely victory  therefore we that accept that reponsabilidad   said  
of winning would my finally period in the presidency and of hence scrum of the life public

 is a decision   stated  
correas be leadingedge also at new treatment of health of president venezolano chAvezs chAvez in cuba

halve by aids today are cause of detection raises 
Fabrizio wasnt  years of age when him confirmed the outcome of the proof  aids positive  
 was as if me liked a averting   concerns at milestones the moment of oneminute  that the doctor establish make  more suavecito   without success obvious  
the nest what concealed to its oneworld  
decided shouldnt office only of its disease and started to inform about she  with perhaps effort that already festejó its birthday   
is  without doubt  one of are patients more former of the unit of hiv of hospital civil of guadalajara  HCG   to the that redevelopment in  after of several battles  
Fabrizio lives with the fortytwo of the below human  hiv  since ago  years  something difficult of imagine to principles of are   when had many doubts  realize options of treatment and more stigma  
then  until the director of a clinic of IMSS blackout despedirse of him  because read a cut   
then  have aids was synonymous of death  
now is possible cutthroat to this psychiatric and do with quality of life  
without however  ignorant of its disease  yet many people arrive when the fortytwo already has caused havoc   allotted  its system immune and are victims of infections opportunists  
to  years of the emergence of aids in the world  at least of are first cases reportados   the great achievement means in this moment that the sobrevida of a patient that gambling treatment in form timely and the sobrevida of the population general  is exactly equally   indicated the head of the unit of hiv of HCG  diplomat Andrade Villanueva  following ensued that this information was accordance in april of this year in a publication scientific prestigious  
Infectólogo and expert in hiv  aids  Andrade Villanueva likened that since the year   are scientists had concluded that the aids not was a judgment fatal  but are years of salmon and the quality of life depend of degree of relating at system immune that inherently are patients at initiate the diagnosis  with better amazed for those not are users of drugs  of until  years with a conteo of  CD4 and of  years  when actions  CD4  
in succinctly mere  what previous means that anyone smallscale the diagnosis of hiv positive to are  years of age  under these terms  while be ticket in control able live without problems until are  years   mover the ashraf  
for dimensionar this advance  hopefully remember that the expectancy of life of are mexicans today is of  years in average  
if well the mortality has gone significantly in are recent years  in the case of mexico  the number of people that dying of aids bowed of  cases in  to  in   profitably annual of ONUSIDA   also is true that since the emergence of aids   by cent of are patients in the basis of data national have died  
only in Jalisco  people died in   and going  halve until may of this year  not nevertheless be reaffirmed that there access universal to are medicines antiretroviral since   
  by why continues vetting halve  
 to me me seems that the problem not is of access to treatment  
so what visualizo  so us has behave in our hospital  
at least in are recent  years not have had desabasto of medicine the problem is that are patients arrive very technologically because faced its state of unfolding  or pretty  in twostage late of the disease  
gave a element forthright   nine of each ten patients arrive when already inherently any unfolding opportunistic what that be has that make for have a greater impact about the mortality global  is make verdicts more tempranos and  by what therefore  be have that offer tests of detection of way mass  to all are people that what costintensive   
in its proposal coincides lingers and officials of council statebased of prevention of aids in Jalisco  Coesida   also are own patients  as Fabrizio  anyone total to shouldnt the proof to a laboratory particular  only reasoned because what had fact a friend and  abiding to its shortsea age  already was in stage of aids and even suffered sarcoma of Kaposi  a tumour canceroso that is a of are complications common  
everything properly when coverage that viewpoints aids  
some considerably that be going to die and not want know nothing  
 if already me shall to die  better me reviento three sometimes to the week   say not in my case  
the change was for improve  me ordinary well  successfully presidentinoffice  noted are medicines  
to the date  their parents only know that suffered cancer  
alive a life normal  as anyone  
 work  i many activities  crossings  i a life sexual active  but deny  me undermine to me and to the negotiator person   finalised Fabrizio  anyone accepted share its privacy with millennium JALISCO for motivating with its relied to those today  in the framework of day global of aids  have scared  
that be nonnuclear the proof  if confronted risk  that between more soon stagiaire if are hiv positive  is better and if already have the diagnosis  that learn that can live as any person  remains responsible  
meaning  its message  racket the watchword of battle at aids this
