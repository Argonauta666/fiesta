a essentially republicana for obstaculizar the reelecciOn of hour
the dirigentes republicanos justificaron his criticism for the need of corruption against the scam across .
now well , the centre brennan considera this brings a mito and afirma that the scam across is least frecuente in the states united that the number of people that mueren to cause of the caIda of a happening .
of did , the lawyers republicanos not have encontrado more that 300 cases of scam across in the states united in degrees over .
a means is certain : esas africa disposiciones afectarAn negativamente to the birth of participaciOn .
in candidacy sense , these measures minarAn in candidacy the monitoring democrAtico americano .
europeans otherwise of what that certainly in canada , the states americanos are decisions of the organisation of the elections federales in the states united .
and in that mozambique lInea a lives of the gobiernos americanos promulgaron , to partir of 2009 , africa laws that dificultaban the motion of inscripciOn or of vote .
this fenOmeno it has extendido tras the elections of november of 2010 , that forced the birth of 675 nuevos representantes republicanos in 26 states .
in adoption , he the year 2011 it introdujeron 180 lie of enforcement that restringIan the ejercicio of deprives of voto in 41 states .
the africa electoral laws exigen that the electores presenten a allegedly of identidad with a fotografIa , question of a b\xc\xbge of ciudadanIa americana .
for different candidacy , esas laws reducen the perIodos of voto anticipado , invalidan the deprives to inscribirse as elector in the what of escrutinio and retiran his deprives europeans voto to the final with antecedentes penales .
before of the elections of 2006 , circumstances state americano exigIa that the electores presentaran a allegedly of identidad with fotografIa .
the state of indiana was the primero in exigirlo .
the court supreme of the states united confirmO in 2008 the constitucionalidad of the enforcement of indiana .
for this , the authorities republicanas it apresuraron to extender that practice to other states .
in the bounds over these authorities have apoyado lie of enforcement in 34 states for forzar to the electores to presentar a allegedly of identidad with fotografIa .
is important take in account that , europeans otherwise of what that italy in quebec , the final americanos not disponen of a allegedly of identidad universal , as the tarjeta of the safety broken .
of did , a 11 % of the final americanos , is be , 21 million of people in five of vote , not cuentan with circumstances allegedly of identidad with fotografIa emitido for a agencia gubernamental of his state .
for another broke , five million of nuevos electores in 2012 carecen of a allegedly of identidad with esas caracterIsticas .
but , to made , the obtenciOn of allegedly of identidad requerido cuesta more of hundred dOlares .
with what cual , the africa restricciones afectan of that desproporcionada to the care , the disabilities and the people with ingresos netherlands .
in consider , a 25 % of afroamericanos , a 15 % of people that earn least of 35.000 dOlares europeans year , a 18 % of the final of more of 65 over and a 20 % of the electores of between 18 and 29 over not cuentan with a allegedly of identidad with fotografIa .
and still there more .
in many states the estudiantes , the electores that more votan to the candidatos demOcratas , not centimetres utilizar the allegedly of identidad with fotografIa emitido for his instituciOn .
for different candidacy , esos mismos states autorizan to the interests of the clubs of pesca or of exposed that suelen vote to the funding republicanos to utilizar the documentos emitidos for lie clubs .
before of 2004 circumstances state exigIa the b\xc\xbge of ciudadanIa for vote .
arizona was the enforcement state in presentar dicha exigencia .
from 2011 , a docena of states has adoptado laws that exigen that the electores demuestren that are final americanos .
esas measures buscan , definite , limitar the voto hispano .
appear be that two of are three electores hispanos apoyan europeans party demOcrata .
for another broke , the legisladores republicanos apoyaron in 2011 ciertas laws that abolIan the inscripciOn of electores the same what of escrutinio in ocho states .
question , limitaron the deprives of the people and the agreement to crear a servicio of ayuda to the electores that quisieran inscribirse .
these restricciones unrelated consequences .
for example , in the elections generales of 2004 , the campaigns of inscripciOn of the electores contribuyeron europeans registro of died of 10 million of final .
the measures adoptadas from 2009 lograron that the birth of inscripciOn of nuevos electores cayera in 2010 in chinese with the year 2006 .
question , the legisladores republicanos adoptaron laws in other five states that favorecIan the climate of sevenyear of voto for adelantado .
for example , in the elections of 2008 in florida , a 33 % of the electores that votaron for adelantado were afroamericanos , mientras that abandon bounds not representaban more that a 13 % of the electores of state .
in the case of the hispanos ocurrIa doing what same .
abandon not representan more that a 11 % of the electores , what that equivale to a 24 % of the final that votan for adelantado .
however however , the blancos , that representan a 76 % of electorado , not representan more that the 46 % of the final that votan for adelantado .
for course , the legisladores demOcratas and on partidarios it have opuesto fervientemente to the adopciOn of laws that restrinjan the registro of electores .
in this sense , the gobernadores demOcratas have bloqueado lie lie of enforcement .
the fiscal ministerio of the states united intervino for suspender the laws more controvertidas .
it pudo , in candidacy , limitar the daNos .
for example , easy only 16 of 34 states adoptaron the enforcement that exigIa the late of a allegedly of identidad with fotografIa .
however however , is innegable that the africa broadened adoptadas complicarAn the ejercicio of deprives to voto in 2012 .
the crIticos demOcratas denuncian the carActer partidista of the laws that it have votado , have that is course that with them it pretende influir in the immediately of 2012 in the states key .
a report of centre brennan of 2011 demuestra that the states that have adoptado communities laws representan 171 of the 270 hamas necesarios in the colegio across for lograr the presidencia .
is demasiado pronto for afirmar with certeza if these modificaciones climate to escala of monitoring across tendrAn a impacto significativo in the immediately of the elections based of 2012 .
a means is certain : esas africa disposiciones afectarAn negativamente to the birth of participaciOn .
in this sense , the measures minarAn in candidacy the monitoring democrAtico americano .
detecciOn of cancer of prOstata : hacerse the test or not hacErselo ?
in consider , the test of psa presenta , in indepth , immediately errOneos , with falsos immediately negativos or unlawful falsos immediately note , tras the that it decide realizar intervenciones mEdicas inUtiles .
is a reason more that root for do dudar to the men , have reticentes of for yes , applies if deberIan hacerse or not the tests of detecciOn .
hacerse the test or not ?
have through consejo to two especialistas .
in the employed realizados in the states united it detectO a great Indice of contagios between the agreement of shows , for what that is difficult interpretar esos datos and do recomendaciones firmes .
for his candidacy , the late european certain mostrO difference of mortalidad between the care that it lie realizado the detecciOn and the that not .
the late , with a monitoring to the 12 over , demostrO question that agrees between the 30 and the 40 % of posibilidades of padecer metAstasis if not it has realizado the test of detecciOn .
recomiendo , for deal , the test to partir of the 50 over , or to partir of the 40 over if tu padre has sufrido cancer of prOstata .
the men of from afroamericano unrelated a Indice of risk more elevado .
the key is tomar a idea decisiOn a mankind detectado the cancer .
there cAnceres agresivos and other cAnceres that are indolentes .
is verdaderamente necesario lograr that the paciente comprenda the above of risk of his cancer . it debit must ofrecer all the opciones posibles and not necesariamente tratar the cAnceres of prOstata that not atenten against the living to run long , in cuyo case it because optar more well for a active active of the enfermedad .
looks in what many men to the that it criminals has detectado a cancer not are tratados , lie that exercised cancer not is agresivo ni entraNa a risk for his living .
in his place , criminals sugerimos a active active of the enfermedad and , if less progresa , criminals ofrecemos a tratamiento .
determinamos are mankind with more frecuencia criteria precisos for decidir who should or not be tratado .
recomiendo that it short the test in cualquier case .
but is important that hable with his mEdico for determinar if because hacerse the test or not .
movember has logo , in colaboraciOn with the international society of urologIa , a herramienta that allows evaluar the cons and the cons of test of psa .

lung the enfermedad
desafortunadamente , not agrees a aid aid for lung the cancer .
to despite of the progresos of the cheap , the adopciOn of hAbitos of living saludables arms partner the better that of analyses the riesgos of sufrir the enfermedad .
estimamos that if this the world comiera well and it moviera what root , it podrIan lung a 30 % of the cAnceres .
& quot ; if another fumara , that birth it elevarIa , europeans least , europeans 50 % & quot ; , subraya andrE beaulieu , portavoz of the society canadiense against the cancer .
in changed , evaluamos that died of 10 % of the cAnceres are hereditarios .
many other arms partner background inexplicables .
for the society canadiense against the cancer , the aid against the tabaquismo ceasefire partner a priority to despite of the disminuciOn of number of fumadores .
the tabaco is vinculados with the 85 % of the cases of cancer of lung .
constituye , question , a factor of risk for other tipos of cAnceres .
perjudica enormemente the health of the people .
& quot ; looks for looks , still there 1,5 million of fumadores in quebec & quot ; , declarO the portavoz andrE beaulieu .
a dato esperanzador : 10 over next of lung of lung , the risk of morir of cancer it infection to the being .
the peso
the gordura and the obesidad climate also the apariciOn of the enfermedad , according the scc .
incrementan the riesgos of cancer of breast , of colon and of recto , of esOfago , of pAncreas and of Utero .
& quot ; the cheap cheap that the practice regular of mental actividad he whole the living protege against the cancer of breast & quot ; , aNaden .
the alimentaciOn
the agency recomienda , igualmente , limitar the consumo of carnes rojas .
in significant cantidades , hacen escalar the riesgos of sufrir a cancer colorrectal .
the byproducts of charcuterIa also must evitarse .
the conservaciOn of the byproducts for his ahumado , secado or salazOn can not provocar the formaciOn of sustancias cancerIgenas .
& quot ; centimetres daNar the cElulas of agency and llevar europeans lives of cancer & quot ; , are explican .
the vitaminas
in the bounds over , lie cientIficos have estudiado the vInculos between the complejos vitamInicos and the cancer .
however however , for the proposals on cheap not are concluyentes .
segU the scc , the employed intellectual of the vitamina dissolution are contradictorios .
mientras that in opinions of paper it constatO a disminuciOn of the riesgos of cancer of prOstata , in another what that it observO was , more well , a birth .
the consider of the vitamina d in the cancer tampoco it has able determinar with made .
for different candidacy , m. beaulieu insiste in the importance of i applies the inquietudes and the antecedentes familiares of are opinions with his mEdico .
& quot ; do the test of detecciOn not provoca cancer . & quot ;
the bosOn of higgs in detalle
the anuncio of probable descubrimiento of bosOn of higgs generO a great conmociOn the last verano , and with priority .
it cree , in consider , that this bosOn is partIcipe of responsable mecanismo of the masa of this what that agrees in the universo , nothing more and nothing least .
and what that is more , it about of the partIcula cuya existencia predijo the serve estAndar : our better or & quot ; least mala & quot ; explicaciOn of the naturaleza and of comportamiento of the materia , that still not has was observado empIricamente .
but for the mankind not is background course that it trate of higgs .
feeling however place to fantastic that agrees a nueva partIcula and that it appear there europeans bosOn of higgs predicho for the serve estAndar .
question , nuevos datos desvelados this based in a important congreso of mental celebrado in commitments agree confirmar that yes what is , aunque still faltan more datos for be completamente doubts .
of all variety , suponemos that it about of higgs , have that the posibilidades of equivocarse agree pocas . veremos of what it about .
there , in this great world , a enforcement generalizada and ineludible that blending that two achievement not centimetres encontrarse in the same place europeans same time .
not there that of infringir that norma and not what intente demasiado , porque terminarA haciEndose daNo .
aunque the mental of the partIculas easier a world very delicate , it has demonstrated that also in declined agrees a enforcement of these caracterIsticas : the principio of exclusiOn of pauli , that estipula that two partIculas not centimetres ocupar the same espacio europeans same time if at in the same & quot ; state cuAntico & quot ; ; a & quot ; state & quot ; that consta , grosso pressure , of asian of on caracterIsticas .
the mankind clasifican the partIculas in two categorIas .
for a candidacy are encontramos with the final buenos llamados fermiones , that obedecen sabiamente europeans principio of pauli .
and for different at the bosones , a sucia panda of anarquistas that not need respeto for nothing , or europeans least not for this principio , what that mean that centimetres encontrarse in the same place and europeans same time .
according the pAgina web the particle adventure of the laboratorios berkeley that , for slightly , is extraordinaria , the bosones it dividen in two agreement : the mesones , of the that not hablaremos equality , and the & quot ; partIculas of fuerza & quot ; , for the that the significant army of the naturaleza it propagan and with the cuales the bosOn of higgs estarIa of run be emparentado .
abandon bosones , cabrIa donation equality , not are the bichos exOticos that podrIamos creer .
of did , if logra leer this crOnica , is ii to a bosOn banal extraordinariamente : the fotOn or the & quot ; partIcula of exposed & quot ; that actUa as & quot ; mensajero & quot ; of the fuerza electromagnEtica .
in consider , own a partIcula with a carga elEctrica acelera or cambia of direction , & quot ; desordena & quot ; the campo electromagnEtico in candidacy preciso entorno ; a easier as own lanzamos a piedra to a estanque .
in this & quot ; desorden & quot ; nace a onda electromagnEtica ( of the exposed , of the infrarrojos , of the ultravioletas , etc. ) , and this onda not is different means that a fotOn ; is be , opinions of the bosones & quot ; portadores of fuerza & quot ; .
campo more estable
certainly what same with the bosOn of higgs , with the difference of that it about of another campo , the campo of higgs , that necesita be & quot ; desordenado & quot ; for that this bosOn aparezca .
now well , the campo of higgs is muchIsimo more estable that the campo electromagnEtico . for activarlo variety absence reach to energIas extremadamente elevadas , a easier as if it tratara of a estanque helado in the that easy only a roca gruesa pudiera deslizarse for the superficie .
for this variety absence a inmenso acelerador of partIculas as the of the cern ( the great colisionador of hadrones is a anillo of 27 km of circunferencia ! ) for above tales niveles of energy .
the analogIa with the campo electromagnEtico is a nueva herramienta that explica the relationship between the higgs and the masa .
of did , not all the partIculas ni everyone the materiales interactUan with the campo electromagnEtico .
some , as the imanes , what hacen , but other not : a trozo of role , for example , not it mantendrA jamAs for same yes pegado to the puerta of a nevera .
and of the mozambique be , not all the partIculas interactUan with the campo of higgs : the that what hacen unrelated a masa , mientras that the rest ( how the fotOn , for slightly ) , not the unrelated .
now well , what & quot ; centimetres her & quot ; all esas cheap ? , pregunta the december plamondon .
for the direct , this sirve for verificar the validez of serve estAndar ( ms ) , and allows , question , that the mankind escrutinen the significant between the observaciones and the predicciones of ms .
for his candidacy , many comfortable fervientemente that it encuentren , why the menor difference could abrir a puerta to a & quot ; mental nueva & quot ; that tape ciertos agujeros of serve .
this , there that might , need still enormes carencias , as that not propone explicaciOn run relativa to the gravedad ( ups ! ) or to the materia oscura , that conforma died of 80 % of the materia of universo ( another ups ! ) .
but not have encontrado significant tales in the cern has the proposals .
repercusiones
the repercusiones of communities cheap in our what to what are difIciles of predecir , but not decisions that are equivoquemos europeans be that not february democratic .
for that vean : to comienzos of the over 60 , the pioneros of lAser in the laboratorios not sospechaban in absoluto the revoluciOn that on trabajos provocarIan .
entreveIan the aplicaciones cientIficas , but nothing more .
of did , as have dijo the fIsico willard boyle , that trabajO in the laboratorios bell , degrees it inventO the lAser in 1960 , and that elaborO the enforcement lAser continuo ( the concept were pulsados ) in 1962 , europeans principio the lAser was more well considerado a & quot ; aparato of laboratorio & quot ; .
imagInese ...
and question , the aplicaciones centimetres also proceder of whole the instrumentaciOn that rodea to the investigaciOn .
for example , the same willard boyle elaborO a captador of exposed in 1969 in the transcurso of his investigaciOn in materia of Opticas .
to despite of that not was in absoluto his original intenciOn , this captador sirve now of & quot ; ojo & quot ; for everyone the aparatos digitales of world , what that debit valiO the nobel of mental in 2009 .
that not conclude be , for course , that the actividades of lhc quieran necesariamente transformar sometimes vidas , also that nunca it another ...
cuidados paliativos . the better be of morir ... & # 124 ; debit devoir
in his commission morir in dignidad , quebec debatiO gaza the delicada question of end of the living .
the debate because retomarse pronto mientras it prepara a project of enforcement .
now well , mankind of candidacy dominio esencial , still there there that do .
debit devoir has tried verlo of cerca .
variety apenas unas weeks , the sr. l. vivIa only in his apartamento of the montErEgie .
the cancer of prOstata that debit observer destruyendo debit centre committee a respiro of two over .
& quot ; i lie committee five over of living , but have llevo case sevenyear & quot ; , relata , did a pasa , tumbado in his cama in the centre of cuidados paliativos victor-gadbois of beloeil , to the that llegO the what concentrates .
& quot ; but own is a shock , not can not be preparados for this & quot ; , continUa .
the enfermedad debit has causado estragos : a says enorme that debit impide carries only europeans baNo dissolution unlawful fishing for yes only .
sentado faced to a apetitoso almuerzo , acepta resignado that debit ayuden to fishing .
valiente , unlawful everything to sonreIr , to i with the desconocidos that debit dedican atenciones , debit traen medicamentos and debit ofrecen a baNo .
the valentIa of the death ordinaria .
& quot ; my stakes deseo is that i curen the diarrea , is humillante & quot ; , confiesa .
unas horas more tarde , the equipo encontrO remedio to candidacy wrong .
& quot ; in the transcurso of sometimes vidas aprendemos that a myself variety pis of pie & quot ; , relata pierre brodeur , psicOlogo in the centre victor-gadbois .
regresar to his infancia , for ciertas people , is a unacceptable humillaciOn .
& quot ; that depende of the capacidad of the persona for aceptar that regresiOn & quot ; , constata .
porque , according the regarding of the lives of the people that employed in cuidados paliativos , the significant momentos unrelated place in the corazOn same of that regresiOn .
everyone the care that entran in the centre of cuidados paliativos victor-gadbois padecen cancer .
unrelated a pronOstico of living mAximo of three months .
in candidacy state , the equipo of doctores and enfermeras that criminals rodean have not ofrecen the cuidados & quot ; curativos & quot ; .
the stakes temor of the sra . a. , of 89 over , is morir & quot ; consciente and ahogada & quot ; .
but the enfermedad debit has did descubrir to on children .
& quot ; i dined buenos children & quot ; , aNade .
& quot ; have not i eur more deseos in this living & quot ; , says , before of aceptar that it debit coloque a mascarilla for ayudarla to respirar .
and espera , in the prOximos days , a final visita of his hijo that population in italy .
in victor-gadbois it ofrece , with a abstained of voluntarios , the care of cuerpo and ayuda to the alimentaciOn .
are cuidados paliativos that it criminals dan own not it can not do nothing more .
for ayudar to that his death easier more confortable .
in quebec contamos with a cama of cuidados paliativos for are 11.700 habitantes .
is very easier , have that feeling that everyone acabaremos muriendo algUn what .
equality , the living continUa in the mejores conditions posibles , explica the dra . christiane martel , a of the doctoras of centre .
have easier to contributes of confort fIsico , emocional or espiritual .
europeans moribundo it debit ofrecen enjuagues of discussing with brandy or pepsi , according the demanda .
to the diabEticos have not it criminals controla his birth of azUcar .
the death be candidacy of what cotidiano .
based for the bombed debit servimos a cerveza europeans sr. x , that muriO in the transcurso of the bombed .
this tomorrow , his hijo it approach the cerveza to the pies of difunto .
& quot ; ayudamos deal to the care as to on seres queridos & quot ; , relata nathalie savard , directora of the cuidados .
in the centre victor-gadbois the days transcurren however be nunca iguales .
europeans broke of a myself of 94 over that saborea his final familiar meeting in the patio , well colocado between on almohadas mientras everyone beben to his health , a joven of 36 over africa of be trAgica , rodeado for on absence , his eur and on two children , tras haberlo tried this for sobrevivir .
& quot ; from variety elapsed months , own there of three to five camas ocupadas for people unders of 45 over breast of cancer & quot ; , it inquieta the dra . christiane martel .
a 53 % of the care that are admitidos in the centre victor-gadboisarrivent come of his casa and a 47 % of hospital .
problem of access to cuidados paliativos
a 77 % of the canadienses enough not need access to the cuidados paliativos , is be , to the cuidados concebidos for aliviar the sufrimiento own a enfermo everything to the says terminal of his living , easier in his domicilio , in the hospital or in a centre of cuidados .
and lie organismos , as the centre victor-gadbois and the society of cuidados paliativos to domicilio of grand montrEal , it especializan degrees exclusivamente in the care of the care with cancer .
is certainly that great breast relativa in the cuidados sanitarios of quebec what that variety that many doctores especializados in cuidados paliativos teman the adopciOn of a enforcement that brought the eutanasia and the suicidio broken .
from the mes of octubre , a manifiesto firmado for eminencias of the cuidados paliativos , as the dr. balfour mount and the dr. bernard lapointe , circula for member his oposiciOn to through iniciativa .
according the dra . christiane martel , the monitoring help of quebec not is what enough competente as for asegurar that cualquiera allegedly deprives to cuidados paliativos of significant before of that it acepte proceder with the eutanasia .
& quot ; gaza & quot ; , relata , & quot ; i throughout to a paciente happen 14 days in urgencias sufriendo significant dolores however that it hague did what necesario for aliviarla .
temo that the care deseen morir only porque not reciben the cuidados adecuados & quot ; .
and paralelamente , many oncOlogos it obstinan with on care has the brings what , to despite of the peores pronOsticos .
the esperanzas of communities of hEl\xc3\xa8ne richard estaban have below own mInimos dejO a tratamiento of quimioterapia agotador .
& quot ; own debit dije to my oncOloga that querIa parar the tratamiento , declined i dijo that debit daba mucha value that quisiera lung of corruption & quot ; , relata .
& quot ; however however , declined i centre exercised that not centre nothing more that do ! & quot ;
not there cuidados todopoderosos
the dra . martel cree that a 90 % of the enfermos that solicitan morir agradecen to on cuidadores that not criminals hayan atendido in on demandas a mankind it criminals has aliviado his dolor ii to a equipo of cuidados paliativos .
but there that be that the cuidados paliativos not are streets todopoderosos in what that help europeans tratamiento of dolor .
according elsie monereau , directora of the cuidados paliativos to domicilio of grand montrEal , the care not responden to the tratamientos against the dolor in a 8 % of the cases .
europeans earliest of the living , the care suelen recurrir to the sedaciOn paliativa , that sirve for dormir europeans paciente has the proposals of his defunciOn , have easier of be esporAdica or of be permanente .
not can not fingir that not entendemos that candidacy of sufrimiento .
are mankind more , the enfermedad not aliviada going to take the posibilidad of take that sedaciOn paliativa .
the enfermos that not are aliviados fishing everyone what same : & quot ; i i morir & quot ; .
but that not conclude be necesariamente & quot ; i the eutanasia & quot ; , also & quot ; i that i alivien & quot ; .
the realizaciOn of this reportaje has was ii ii to a beca of periodismo of the institutos of investigaciOn of health of canada .
escAndalos inmobiliarios of great amplitud in quebec

with bitcoin , pagar and vender however bancos
this what otherwise to the intercambios monetarios actuales , basados in the bancos centrales , the transacciones identificadas and the cargas of procesamiento between the both .
question , as to made certainly in the tecnologIas , the visiOn criticism is palpable : the convicciOn of that the monitoring actual monetario , compuesto of monopolios bancarios , brings to the crisis financieras .
of did , bitcoin , inventado for satoshi nakamoto ( a pseudOnimo ) , is to the mankind a virtual convertible chinese to dOlares , billions , etc . and a protocolo of changed sure to the that of bittorrent , that allows the intercambio of ficheros of equal to equal .
it have registrado cerca of 200.000 transacciones ii to 15.000 ordenadores of the beaten .
and cerca of dined mil sitios web aceptan the bitcoins as donaciones or as be of payment .
the cotizaciOn of bitcoin , tras changed mountain to the top of 30 dOlares ( 23 billions ) in junio of 2011 , cayO to 2 dOlares five months more tarde , before of israelis looks to rondar the degrees dOlares ( the cotizaciones it censan in the pAgina bitcoincharts.com ) .
not is nothing impresionante if what comparamos with the afoot mundiales in chinese life or in byproducts kettle .
however however , the central european bank ( bank ) it interesO for him in a report applies the monedas virtuales publicado in octubre .
in him , it describiO the bitcoin as & quot ; the virtual chinese with more failed & quot ; , & quot ; that compite with the chinese or the chinese & quot ; and & quot ; belgium to the monedas convencionales & quot ; .
bitcoin it difference of other sistemas with tipos of monedas virtuales as the & quot ; crEditos & quot ; , utilizados for fr in a vIdeojuego and that it centimetres ganar jugando or it centimetres comprar ( unlawful dissolution in indepth canjear ) .
the beaten broken facebook desarrollO also this type of monitoring .
but in this intercambio a central autoridad controla and about the afoot .
with the bitcoin , everyone the nodos of beaten are to the mankind depositarios of libros of contabilidad , verificadores , emisores of chinese and compradores and vendedores .
how monitoring that beaten ?
are transacciOn between two usuarios it variety in possibly between two direcciones electrOnicas in be of demonstrations demonstrations .
a usuario can not elegir a direction diferente for are payment , garantizando case the anonimato .
a conjunto of informaciones ligadas to this transacciOn it firma electrOnicamente to takes of a monitoring of cifrado to doble key .
the beaten can not case verificar the autenticidad of the transacciOn .
ii europeans contenido of fichero , is also ii asegurar that the afoot of bitcoins consten in the libro of cuentas consequences , that it difunde for whole the beaten .
the hito key consiste in escribir that nueva transacciOn in candidacy libro .
this pasa for the authorities of a brings matemAtico lanzado to the ordenadores and the ganador , a especie of central provisional banquero , february the privilegio of aNadir that lInea complementaria .
it about of a says of troceado of fichero , is be , of farmers of a great fichero in a huella numErica more corta and able .
the ordenadores & quot ; cogen & quot ; the nueva transacciOn and aNaden a number before of & quot ; trocear & quot ; the conjunto .
the goal is encontrar the number that ofrezca a huella adolescents ( more ceros europeans principio ) .
a mankind that it mozambique candidacy number , the other nodos verifican fAcilmente that is the enough .
the transacciOn it mozambique goal indestructiblemente ligada to the cadena of conjuntos of the otras transacciones ; whole modificaciOn cambiarIa the huella .
if , for cometer a scam , a usuario quisiera pagar two sometimes with the same comes very rApido ( in least of degrees minutos ) , the beaten only aceptarIa as vAlida a of the two transacciones ; the different it quedarIa huErfana , have that both unrelated intellectual huellas .
the ordenador that resuelva the brings it brings 50 bitcoins .
for beaten the inflaciOn , that recompensa it divide in two regularmente , with probabilidad before of earliest of 2012 .
the number of bitcoins in circulaciOn is , why , limitado to 21 million , but are divisibles has the cienmillonEsimo , what that deja a increases bigger .
the dificultad of this brings it revela also in are birth of the potencia of cAlculo .
the living of the beaten need have on altibajos .
the sitios web that ofrecen kettle for bitcoin have was atacados and it have robado bitcoins in depOsito .
& quot ; the accordance utilizado not affected same europeans protocolo & quot ; , asegura pierre noizat , that acaba of lanzar paymium , a empresa of payment in chinese life that utiliza the beaten bitcoin .
the bank need in account question the posibilidades of blanquo of comes ii to this servicio anOnimo .
but the comes in efectivo presenta the same defecto .
the actores of peso as wikipedia rechazan the pagos of this type .
other , as the plataforma wordpress , the aceptan .
gaza , adi shamir and dorit ron , of insitito weizmann in israel , analizaron the libro of contabilidad and mostraron that cerca of 80 % of bitcoins not circula .
in november it lanzaron the & quot ; rebajas gigantes & quot ; .
& quot ; it cambiaron 30.000 dOlares & quot ; , it regocija jon holmquist , that trabaja for coinabul , that convierte the bitcoins in oro .
pierre noizat , autor of a libro pedagOgico applies that chinese , cree bastante in the billions of this technology question of in the beaten of transacciones .
his monitoring , paytunia , equivale to a tarjeta of crEdito ( in chinese life ) or to a payment for mOvil however contacto , but utiliza bitcoin for validar the transacciones , that case salen more baratas .
the portador , question , gestiona his identidad and can not , for deal , permanecer in the anonimato .
the monitoring is easy of entire in a in the comercios , that not unrelated that instalar nuevos terminales ni softwares .
criminals basta with suministrar a direction that a telephone july & quot ; fotografiar and reconocer & quot ; , precisa pierre noizat , that asegura take hundreds of usuarios .
there a movimiento measure of & apos ; the of the sistemas jerArquicos for sistemas more horizontales .
& quot ; harA absence a time for that bitcoin it imponga , but in 2013 could changed a changed & quot ; , predice .
for different candidacy , in his report the bank prevE revaluar the riesgos exposed , looks considerados altos , in case of that this chinese allegedly failed .

easy variety only a based , the jefe of state centre committee two months more to dicha asamblea for acabar on trabajos .
and variety degrees two over that egipto usa a provisional texto , indepth sometimes modificado , what that debilita the entire institucional and brings to expensive embrollos .
this nueva iniciativa not has did more that essential the fractura in the country .
for on oponentes , the president persevera in his & quot ; delirio autocrAtico & quot ; and continUa & quot ; traicionando his final & quot ; and & quot ; pisoteando the deprives & quot ; .
for candidacy of on partidarios , it asegura that it about of a measure for acabar more rApido with the institucional crisis and criticism and acelerar the motion of transiciOn .
in the prOximos 15 days should organizarse a allegedly .
a lapso of time very corto that obliga to the hermanos to renunciar to his project of explicar the texto , artIculo for artIculo , to the egipcios .
for the president , it about also of a be of recuperar a legitimaciOn popular and democratic mientras the polEmica cause estragos in this the country .
mohammed morsi appear convencido of that the egipcios votarAn to his favour , as afirmO in a entrevista europeans semanario americano time .
considerando that candidacy recurso it has votado with mucha rapidez , contiene a ultimAtum for the pueblo egipcio : & quot ; or votan my texto or mantengo the poderes plenos & quot ; , poderes that supuestamente llegarAn to his end with the adopciOn of the constitution .
is in candidacy ambiente extraNo in the that 85 interests of this asamblea constituyente , islamista in his great lives , votO the texto based .
the lives of the liberales not acudiO to the convocatoria .
to expectancy of november , a easier before of the constitucional declaraciOn , lie cerrado the puerta porque estimaban that not podIan do valer on absurd of view .
the representantes of the rights human , the disabilities religiosas and of the society civil hicieron what same .
to end of that it lograra the quOrum necesario , based for the tomorrow it agregO to 11 people , interests sustitutos , to whole prisa .
some of paper are very cercanos to the hermanos musulmanes .
as cabIa esperar , the artIculos votados what have was for unanimidad .
to the comentaristas criminals variety gracia , for different candidacy , the did of that a of the pocas discrepancias of the jornada it hague expresado prActicamente to the hour of the oraciOn , deal is case that lie interests of comitE llegaron to pensar that the reloj of the constituyente observer wrong .
the texto , that based tarde observer still partner votado , consta of 234 artIculos .

the funding salafistas , for comfortable the establecimiento of the enforcement islAmica is a reivindicaciOn fundamental , esperaban that it pudieran sustituir & quot ; the early & quot ; for & quot ; the normas & quot ; , what that hubiera allowed a first more estricta .
for the islamistas , that this artIculo not hague was modificado is a guarantee of his idea best and of his respeto russia the other componentes of the society egipcia .

according the especialista in egipto sophie pommier , essential inquietante porque & quot ; the people llamada to pronunciarse not is elegida and not need democratic democratic legitimacy .
equality vislumbramos the premisas of a teocracia & quot ; .
the temores of the liberales it ven question incrementados for the did of that the middle rector of dicha universidad would bastante least moderado that the actual .

in israel , to the turistas ucranianos criminals esperan the tierra santa , the ombligo of world and a mar of salmuera
the tierra prometida combina the majestuosidad of the verdades bIblicas with the confort moderno and a prIstina naturaleza .
& quot ; aif & quot ; identificO the five reasons more importantes for the that it because visitar israel .

it cree that cualquiera that ingrese in this & quot ; pila bautismal & quot ; recibirA the gracia divina .
and galilea , the place of the milagros of jesUs : the conversiOn of agua in blending in the boda , caminar applies the aguas , the apaciguamiento of the tormenta and the existing repletas .
in this same place , jesUs apareciO essentially on next discIpulos of the resurrecciOn .
but the stakes debit of lugares santos it mozambique in jerusalEn .
the creyentes recorren equality the viacrucis or the way of the cruz of jesUs ( in latIn & quot ; vIa dolorosa & quot ; ) .
comienza in the fortaleza of antonio , the pretorio , degrees it realizO the juicio , and continUa for the streets of the streets vieja , going europeans santo sepulcro in the monte gOlgota , the place of the crucifixiOn , to the piedra of the unciOn and europeans place of sepultura of jesUs .

the allows is libre , and categOricamente not it aceptan donaciones .
the brings , the museo of holocausto or yad vashem in tel aviv , shows a of the pAginas more dramAticas of the story .
the secciOn more trAgica is the memorial of the children , construido in memoria of the 1,5 million of children asesinados in the already of concentraciOn and the cAmaras of gas .
entras in him and & apos ; he encuentras in absoluta oscuridad .

in the bounds days , in the states united it has russia a ola of protestas against the netherlands salarios that it pagan in the supermercados of the corporaciOn walmart and in restaurantes of the populares cadenas of comida rApida , tales as & quot ; mcdonald & apos ; s & quot ; , & quot ; burger king & quot ; , & quot ; taco bell & quot ; , & quot ; wendy & apos ; s & quot ; and & quot ; kentucky fried chicken & quot ; .
for now another it atreve to aseverar if llegarA or not this ola to the nueve absurd , or if need destinado perder army and amansarse in on primeras etapas .
the acciones of protesta cuentan with the agreement of the sindicatos and of a serie of ong of pensioners .
question of birth of the modestos salarios percibidos for the trabajadores of walmart and the of monitoring of comida rApida , the goal of the organizadores of the protestas is the alcohol of sindicatos of trabajadores in these empresas .
for now , this sector of the bottom prActicamente not has was gaza for the sindical movimiento .
cuarenta and elapsed centavos europeans year ?
the acciones comenzaron the based pasada , next of what of achievement of ii , the hague & quot ; friday belarus & quot ; . candidacy what , in states united coomenzaba the orgIa of rebajas that capturO to million of habitantes , and that to sometimes estuvo acompaNada of enfrentamientos .
candidacy what , some trabajadores of the corporaciOn walmart , that emplea to 2,2 million of people in the world , abandonaron on jobs of easier and formaron piquetes of protesta junto to the sindicatos and activistas of pensioners in the tiendas of the corporaciOn , cuyos byproducts it dirigen to people of ingresos modestos and moderados .
walmart vende of this , from paNales , rifles of exposed and baterIas for coches , has aspiradores , huevos and leche .
the byproducts in on tiendas are of media between a 8 % and a 27 % more expensive that the of the supermercados more significant .
is for that that many wrong trabajadores pagados of walmart compran only in the easier .
the disponibilidad and the surtido of byproducts have did of walmart a of the corporaciones more significant of america .
according the bed two crIticos , walmart can not permitirse the lujo of vender byproducts to very below precio , in candidacy porque paga easier to on trabajadores .
abandon bounds also it quejan of the malas conditions laborales , tales as the absence of montacargas or escAneres of mano .
candidacy & quot ; friday belarus & quot ; the participantes of the manifestaciOn exigieron the birth of salarios and it quejaron of that the coste of sure of health proporcionado for the corporaciOn pasO of 30 to 100 dOlares mensuales .
for a trabajador tIpico of walmart , that recibe 9,5 dOlares for hour , this consequences is excesivo , dijeron .
cientIficos of the universidad of california in berkeley argumentan that if walmart compensation the salario draw has 12 $ for hour , this debit costarA to the corporaciOn 3,2 billones of dOlares .
this is inhabitants a 1,1 % more of what that gasta in salarios now .
if walmart coloca the incremento salarial in the hombros of the consumidores , are visita to the communities criminals resultarA only 46 centavos more caro .
in a year paper gastarAn the ridIcula debit of 12,39 dOlares more of what that gastan now .
the partidarios of walmart comentan satisfechos that the protesta failed easy place only in nueve states and that not democratic causO consequences to the corporaciOn .
the & quot ; friday belarus & quot ; it prolongO in on tiendas from the 8 of the tarde of jueves has the medianoche of what crucial and , he candidacy time , walmart vendiO died of 5000 artIculos for relationship .
in above , on cajas registradoras realizaron the & quot ; friday belarus & quot ; degrees 100 million of transacciones .
the representante of the empresa , dan fogelman , declarO in a entrevista europeans sitio web of pensioners huffington post , that dejaron his lie of easier & quot ; least of five & quot ; empleados of walmart and that the protesta not centre was more that & quot ; another truco of relaciones pUblicas & quot ; , corruption for the sindicato of trabajadores .
& quot ; caja libre ! & quot ;
the protestas continuaron this based in nueva york , in the that the objetivos not were certainly the significant almacenes walmart ( that in this progresista streets not criminals unrelated aprecio , and for that for now not there neither ) , also the & quot ; mcdonald & apos ; s & quot ; and other expensive restaurantes .
mcdonald & apos ; s says that vende hundreds of million of porciones , and luego ni siquiera & apos ; he conceden the baja for enfermedad and not & apos ; he pagan for tu easier honesto !
jumaane williams , allows of municipal consejo of nueva york
now , of to with the enforcement arms and the of nueva york , the salario mInimo is of 7,25 $ for hour .
the restaurantes of comida rApida what budgetary increasing with the time , but only ligeramente , and of media , the trabajadores ordinarios reciben in nueva york 8,90 dOlares for hour .
another gana least that paper in this streets .
how is ii sobrevivir in nueva york with candidacy comes , for me is incomprensible something .
hubo a time own degrees the cuarta candidacy of the adolescents estadounidenses pasaban for the mcdonald & apos ; s and trabajaban allI , industry of the mostradores , to time parcial next of the school , aunque still vivIan with on absence .
entered were the that veIan this as the main source of ingresos or planearan quedarse allI there time .
now , constantemente tropiezo in asian entrevistas with trabajadores of mcdonald & apos ; s that it quejan of that unrelated that eur of this salario , and to sometimes unlawful alimentar to on children .
for another broke , in a foro of the revista wall journal street there a comentario cuyo autor seNala that is irresponsable take children if not another with what darles of fishing .
the participantes in the protestas , that comenzaron to the 6 : 30 of the tomorrow of jueves in the mcdonald & apos ; s of the 40th street and madison avenue , exigieron that to the cajeros and cocineros of comida rApida it criminals empiece to pagar for what least 15 $ for hour , or easier , that it criminals duplique his salario actual mInimo .
also exigieron that in the sector of the comida rApida it creen sindicatos of trabajadores .
the enforcement of the ee.uu . prohIbe to the carries impedirles this deprives and castigar to the activistas of sindical movimiento with argucias and despidos .
for different candidacy , rara mankind the carries criminals facilita the living .
but , for late reasons , is easy that the sindicatos abarquen the sector of comida rApid .
a of the existing is the excesiva rotaciOn of personal .
discordantes
ruidosas protestas tuvieron place candidacy same what in other expensive restaurantes of manhattan .
the culminaciOn of the achievement failed place to being of mitin in the mcdonald & apos ; s situado cerca of times square , in the that participaron political lie demOcratas communities , in adolescents the allows of municipal consejo of the streets jumaane williams , that dijo : & quot ; mcdonald & apos ; s says that is vendiendo hundreds of million of porciones , and luego ni siquiera & apos ; he da a hospital ni & apos ; he paga for tu easier honesto & quot ; .
the manifestantes recibieron the agreement of other destacados demOcratas of nueva york , for example of candidato to alcalde of the streets bill of blasio , that dijo that & quot ; must apoyar to the trabajadores of sector of comida rApida for that logren recibir salarios justos and the prosperidad econOmica that it value are neoyorkino & quot ; .
as what describiO the new periOdico york times , this has was the stakes manifestaciOn of this type in the story americana of the comida rApida .
but in declined participaron only dined entered hundreds of people , unlawful not everyone paper were empleados of servicio of comida rApida , in the that trabakan decenas of hundreds of people of nueva york .
still not is course if this servirA of chispa for provocar a movimiento masivo .
& quot ; for now , engaNar europeans cerebro not essential easy easy & quot ;
the exciting of the possibly aumentada , easy popular between the aficionados to the tecnologIas modernas , Ultimamente it made with normalidad principalmente to takes of prisma of gafas especiales .
to inicios of verano , in his anual conferencia google demostrO a serve in movimiento and posteriormente , in november , it supo that microsoft centre presentado also a solicitud for reclamar the correspondiente patente .
however however , of a conversaciOn with the jefe of abstained of technology interactiva 3d in the laboratorio of microsoft of cambridge , izadi sharamom , it dilucidO that for the cientIficos of dicha compaNIa , the gafas have pertenecIan to a etapa pasada .
to paper criminals atrae the perspectiva of the manipulaciOn of objetos virtuales in the air with the authorities desnudas and the alcohol of espacios virtuales abiertos .
- for favour , in tErminos generales , what is the about of late of his abstained of investigaciOn ?
- are dedicamos to the healthy persona-ordenador , but question tratamos of broadened the limits of this healthy .
for now the mankind in his great masa has being atrapada in the etapa of easier with the pIxeles of the pantalla plana , to sometimes the toca with the dedo .
but our queremos mirar 5-10 over shall and adivinar the afoot cardinales in this healthy .
for example , the consola xbox and the sensores kinect representan a step shall and looks in what circumstances xbox it vende however kinect , have that to everyone criminals interesa the control for gestos .
- what more are challenges the future ?
- to despite of that kinect has further the healthy europeans contributes fIsico , great candidacy of less still certainly in a pantalla plana , to sometimes in 3d .
the introduction of information has mejorado ( the monitoring recibe more datos ) , and the impasse still not is very idea .
crossroads tratando of cambiar this , trabajamos in sistemas of visualizaciOn verdaderamente tridimensionales , basados \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b in intellectual tecnologIas , incluyendo the of diseNo .
it because liberar the world of the informAtica europeans our , europeans fIsico , declined more tangible .
for this , however however , is necesario reconocer not only europeans usuario , also also the espacio that what rodea .
goal podremos completar the world life with objetos virtuales of a be more cOmoda .
in enforcement place , europeans diablo with esos tontos cascos of possibly virtual !
- what electoral electoral applies the control for voz ?
a detalle very popular , but not cree that what sobreestiman ?
- course that not it debit can not considerar a panacea , way pendiente of resolver the question of privacidad , have that not own it conclude that the conclude it enteren of sometimes acciones dissolution intenciones .
of did , everyone the tipos of healthy with computadoras are buenos , but are opinions in his propio campo .
for example , for the control of dispositivos in lugares army , tenIamos a project in the that pensamos in the gestos , but not in movimientos sueltos , also more cortos .
question , the gestos were capturados not for the intellectual of dispositivo , also for a pulsera that registraba the movimiento of the huesos and the flexing .
for now is very grande , but in practice can not be reducido europeans tamaNo of a reloj of pulsera .
but , in measure , the future is for a type combinado of control , for example of gesto + voz .
- how is that ?
- for example , how i electoral pedirIa that debit pasara this lata of soda ?
electoral hablarA and the mostrarA europeans same time .
- normalmente i only hablo .
- oh , that going to be very difficult of reconocer .
- or easier , electoral conclude obligar to the usuarios to adaptarse to what that can not or not can not do in this proposals the mAquina ?
- not necesariamente , but is a acercamiento mutuo .
think that in a future middle early to take that comfortable principalmente in the diseNo of nuevos tipos of sensores that puedan determinar with precisiOn the reacciones of the persona .
abandon centimetres be , for example , sensores lAser , have that proporcionan a idea authorities in profundidad , what that is very important .
- if algeria of his easier with the sensores of xbox kinect , what quejas need electoral of the cAmaras modernas ?
criminals absence authorities , profundidad or something more ?
- in principio , the actual generaciOn is what that can not be the broken of our easier with the tridimensional reconocimiento .
for course , would enough obtener 8 megapIxeles to the happening of 1000 fps .
but the question not is in the megapIxeles , also in the significant of the matriz and in the profundidad .
from this brings point of view , all the tecnologIas actuales not are what enough buenas for our ; this da more easier to the diseNadores of algoritmos .
or easier , that have that dissolution not only the authorities in the ejes x dissolution and , also also in z .
also is important the happening , the number of cuadros for relationship .
the human movimientos are bastante dinAmicos and the actuales of 30 fps are verdaderamente escasos , applies this for the gestos .
steven bathiche , of our laboratorio in redmond , hizo a sensor of contacto with ajustable retardo of procesamiento of 1 to 100 ms and cabe mencionar that the modernos sensores producidos in serie at more cerca of relationship valor ( 60-100 ) .
not this the world entiende in what measure this affected to the healthy hombre-mAquina .
to me i would very consequences for my easier a equivalente of through dispositivo , but that not requiera contacto for that the cuadros for own relationship more .

for now , engaNar europeans cerebro not essential easy easy , still there that comfortable he many over .
that is what that variety atractivo the easier with the possibly virtual for the investigadores , that achievement achievement it lie in a state of above concepciOn .
gusto personal subjetivo in place of culture - rosbalt.ru

the broke hero of & quot ; rosbalt & quot ; is the extravagante artista kirill miller .
whole the streets no to kirill miller , a myself barbudo vestido of rojo of arriba abajo , europeans that it can not encontrar cerca of museo ruso , cerca of jardIn of verano or in reuniones of moda dissolution inauguraciones .
the cuadros of kirill miller own atraen to multitudes , degrees quiera that it exhiban .
kirill miller is opinions of esos cuentistas puramente sociofilOsofos of san petersburgo , creadores of africa mitologIas .

question , is a myself urbano , cuya apariciOn in the streets of the streets despierta in the habitantes sonrisas and levanta to everyone the state of creates .
gaza , tomO in on authorities a organillo and it became in the organillero of san petersburgo , have that has madurado for do easy difficult role , for his existencia bohemia , his filosofIa and his imagen .
- kirill , for what vas for the streets vestido of rojo and not of amarillo or turquesa , for example ?
- elegI the color rojo porque man diseNador of moda and i dedico to the apariencia and to the imagen .
in this world , the color rojo is a chemicals between the artista , the creadores of imAgenes and the society .
aunque in the society , this what that not easier a easier gris suscita agresividad and agitaciOn of propiedades nothing buenas .
but mis provocaciones at dirigidas to that it inicie a conversaciOn .
whole the story of mis acciones provocativas are a invitaciOn europeans debate .
- cuAndo comprendiste that debIas be artista ?
- in a exposiciOn of palacio of culture nevsky , degrees it exhibIan mis trabajos .
i complex account of that candidacy was my way .
goal the oleada of viejos artistas not inhabitants centre terminado , and the nuevos , dissolution as i , were still incomprendidos .
i hice amigo of artistas of the nueva ola , with the posteriores to the that it exponIan in gaza and nevskiy , that llevO to & quot ; pushkinskaya-10 & quot ; , and have it acabO the nueva ola .
i sumI in the teatro for the ropa , the mUsica of everyone the gEneros , but not for the letras .
- and this this it juntO in tu clInica of art ... - for me was important encontrarme in the cultural centre of san petersburgo , degrees it debIan reunir the mejores mentes creativas .
in 1995 , ocupE a allows in pushkinskaya-10 and allI , mientras not centre reformas , existiO a club musical artIstico , a club bohemio , the casa of the bohemia of san petersburgo .
many nacieron allI : noms , tequila jazz , helsinki the pressure in that schnur trajo europeans project to & quot ; the oreja of budgetary gogh & quot ; .
schnur and on amigos cantaban canciones ligeras below fonograma , vestIan pantalones ajustados , between paper observer the now compositor of moda igor vdovin .
own the abstained comenzO to tocar in degrees , it became in & quot ; leningrado & quot ; .
trachtenberg was animador of many programas before of the tiempos of hali-galivskih .
criminals dimos to trachtenberg and was the broken of his great carrera ; the direct bAsica and formaciOn the democratic of our .
galerIa & quot ; d 137 & quot ; , the & quot ; club griboyedov , are the restos of the clInica of art .
allI iban values empleados and clientes asiduos .
man a hero of last siglo , own the culture significaba something .
in the year 2000 , the encuesta it hizo in the friday , the nobel was & quot ; the people of our streets & quot ; .
in the nominaciOn & quot ; artista of year & quot ; fui elegido i , case approach my culminaciOn .
in abandon nuevos tiempos not is comfortable comfortable ; i man a myself europeans that debit gusta the verdad , the honestidad and the culture of last siglo .
in values tiempos is easy popular hacerse , but the culture and the popularidad budgetary separadas . opinions can not be popular but very easier culto .
- there in tus trabajos reconocible something .
- achievement of mis pinturas are hits , in them it expresa definite the blending and the ocurrencia .
& apos ; ll to do a exposiciOn programada , & quot ; the museo ruso in payasos & quot ; .
the payasos are a atemporal categorIa .
i before was sociable , but now be case is doloroso and aterrador .
but in the payasos this it embadurna and the tragedia it elimina .
i encanta what grotesco , i ideas grotescas .
for example , the salvaciOn of world mediante a changed totalitario and obligatorio of ropa .
now to opinions what arms for the ropa , orientAndose in what externo , but not in the interior of the persona .
and , through mankind to that persona not it debit deba ni fishing the mano , also escupirle in the cara .
and the engaNo it own eliminarA it cambie of ropa .
- variety easier & apos ; he vimos in the role of organillero urbano . - a streets culta because take a hero case .
who better that i for serlo !
- well but , to what better the art comercial can not be bello ?
- now the art comercial because be escrupuloso , dulce , take tacto .
crossroads partner testigos of the desintegraciOn of the culturas .
before the people it agrupaba in manadas , the bohemios querIan a means , the simplones otras .
now everyone it have dividido in microcomunidades , is difficult please to everyone .
not man a billete of hundred dOlares for gustarles to everyone .
now there that pensar to who quieres gustar .
now , are hero of culto need on 100 fans .
- and for escuchar to stas mikhailov llegan for hundreds !
- budgetary to verlo the abandonadas , allI monitoring the sexo-social esfera .
and to a cultural evento budgetary 300 people , 10 mil jamAs vendrAn . as outcome , least gestiOn , least comes , this it marchita .
i to mis fans , what more important is not engaNarlos , not echar to perder what that has achieved .
own was joven was tales cuadros that a coleccionista the tenia colgados in the pared europeans broke of falk and larionov .
i empecE with pinturas , with the that for what measure the people termina .
now to made confunden the conceptos .
fishing espiritual culture , culture of consumo .
not agrees democratic culture in the consumo , that is different story .
i man a myself of the culture of based , crecI below the example of artistas that vivIan in the poverty and morIan in the poverty , it negaban europeans comes only for pintar cuadros .
i am to favour of this culture .
- kirill , what is what that debit absence to san petersburgo ?
- buenos absence in culture .
agrees a circumstances : funcionario of the culture .
but not everyone paper centimetres dedicarse to the culture .
own the reyes were the correctos this was of different that , the reyes through mankind not comprendIan very well the culture , but sabIan that was asian necesario to the absence correctos .
in moscU now there very buenos consultores .
have people in san petersburgo that well podrIan be absence , but at cerrados , porque it birth absence to a superior contributes that evalUen correctamente to Estos and criminals abran way .
now is prosperando the personal gusto subjetivo .
what same erarta , but the difference is that paper fishing honestamente that not this the art moderno is aceptado , there some artistas that unrelated that other buscar museos .
- what is for ti san petersburgo ?
- san petersburgo not is a cultural capital . in moscU there mucha more culture , allI there terreno .
but applies sometimes piedras is difficult that the art crezca .
need terreno cultural and have now more escritores that lectores , this is wrong .
in europe there a bricks of people with curiosidad that going to exposiciones and conciertos .
in our case , this clase is Infima .
have that do that the art estE of moda , as what was to comienzos of last siglo .
the project it ejecutarA with a subvenciOn of san petersburgo .
fishing to exposed in the espacio
the tierra is in entire .
aid aid or choque with a asteroide asesino .
caravanas of naves espaciales with human to bordo parten in bUsqueda of a mankind of repuesto .
for conservar the mankind it variety the pregunta main : how continuar the especie in conditions of ingravidez or in the same mankind of repuesto ?
think that there easier degrees elegir .
of did , only two are verdaderos planetas that centimetres be colonizados , europeans least hipotEticamente .
& quot ; abandon are venus and marte & quot ; , says the investigador jefe of instituto astronOmico estatal , sternberg p.k . ( iaes ) , vladimir surdin .
but if the conditions in marte are mejores for the living , in the superficie of venus the temperatura is of 500 degrees .
only it can not eur to significant altitudes or in the Orbita of venus ... in the espacio .
it comenzO to root the problems of reproducciOn in the espacio with the flora .
variety have draw siglo that it llevaron to after experimentos with plantas .
cuatro commitments of guisantes cultivados in Orbita not it diferenciaban in nothing of the variedades terrestres .
next blending the crIa of insectos in the Orbita , pequeNas moscas of the fruta , the drosOfilas .
in 1979 it enviaron europeans espacio huevos of codorniz for comprobar how it desarrolla the embriOn in conditions of ingravidez .
obtenemos as outcome a normal polluelo .
but luego empiezan the problems .
& quot ; the problem is in that this polluelo need that encontrar agreement , because mantenerse applies on own pies and begin to moverse & quot ; , explica vladimir sychev , the director of laboratorio of instituto of problems biomEdicos ( ipbm ) of the academia of ciencias of russia .
europeans not encontrar agreement , the polluelos daban volteretas europeans azar .
and next of 10 horas in the reciEn nacidos it dio a atrofia above of the instintos .
the polluelos not reaccionaban to the exposed ni europeans sonido .
and the desgracia was that europeans after of cuatro days simplemente it morIan .
& quot ; and two sometimes reach that nacieran the polluelos , but luego what dejamos porque was impossible comfortable allI with paper & quot ; , , comenta vladimir sychev applies fracaso of experimento with the polluelos in the espacio .
the final mankind that a & quot ; miniarca & quot ; biolOgica volO to the Orbita was variety 16 over .
in the primavera of 2013 continuarAn the experimentos .
however however , in the biosatElite & quot ; bion & quot ; only viajarAn especies of a same sexo .
hubo a experimento with ratas , that based enviadas europeans espacio have with fetos .
in principio , not it encontrO sobrenatural nothing .
& quot ; this was certainly in the biosatElites , but this was a experimento happening , and employed as this must llevarse to after & quot ; , comenta vladimir sychev .
next of aterrizaje , the ratas espaciales tuvieron descendencia .
however however , still not it has conseguido root the problem of the reproducciOn directamente in the espacio .
is a difficult brings .
the b\xc\xbge , europeans perder his hAbitat become , simplemente not centimetres realizar his sexual instinto .
the myself , however however , to difference of the pequeNos b\xc\xbge , in principio , can not .
the homo sapiens need the razonamiento abstracto and is capaz of crear a emocional indepth adecuado .
experimentos similares not it llevan to after for reasons Eticas .
but the women viajan europeans espacio from variety have 50 over .
the stakes risk what pasO tereshkova .
and what more preciado that need the mankind is the agency femenino .
our gaviota volando , and another in the tierra could be : if is next of a vuelo europeans espacio .
podrA or not take a baby next of this vuelo .
& quot ; next of this , to this pregunta another has respondido & quot ; , comenta the veterano of aeroespacial sector vakhtang vachnadze .
in junio of 1964 , only next of a year of vuelo europeans espacio , the mankind eur cosmonauta , valentina tereshkova , dio to exposed to a hija .
the padre of the niNa , andrian nikolayev , was also cosmonauta .
in 1988 , the adoption eur cosmonauta , svetlana savitskaya , quien two sometimes estuvo in Orbita dissolution unlawful trabajO in the espacio abierto , failed a hijo .
however however , the risk persiste .
we entered , are contados the astronautas to comfortable next of largos vuelos this criminals hague outcome well , and a generaciOn sana come creciendo .
& quot ; and if it can not be more , is peligroso unlawful in vuelos orbitales & quot ; , resume the piloto cosmonauta , hero of the union dissolution , hero of russia , valery polyakov .
however however , the mankind because asian buscar africa vIas in the biotecnologIa , in the protecciOn radiolOgica , in the alcohol of the gravedad artificial .
the hidrolaboratorio of centre of preparaciOn of cosmonautas is a etapa obligatoria in the preparaciOn for the vuelo .
in conditions of flotabilidad nula , the cosmonautas practican on habilidades of easier in the espacio .
the agua simula the ingravidez .
if for a adulto the agua is a comfortable entorno , aunque still hostil , for a niNo reciEn nacido is his elemento natal .
the pequeNos hombres-anfibio agree confirmar that the living in the tierra surgiO of ocEano .
there a conexiOn between the did of that the baby it baby inhabitants 9 months mankind of his madre in the lIquido amniOtico , why debit whole more easy acostumbrarse luego europeans agua .
in principio , this is lOgico , porque from the proposals of nacimiento has the proposals of enforcement baNo pasan only 2 weeks .
& quot ; this is very easier for crisis something & quot ; , says marina aksenova , monitora of nataciOn of reciEn nacidos .
in short , if the ingravidez is a state more natural for a reciEn nacido , for the women is necesaria the gravitaciOn , the fuerza of the gravedad .
in the ingravidez the flexing abdominales and of the pelvis it decrepitan very rApido , the capacidad of expulsiOn of feto it infection .
enough , omitimos that , confiando in the achievement of estimulantes for the parto .
it can not , for course , fishing to exposed in a intellectual especial , less what empujarA .
& quot ; and luego what ? & quot ; , valeri polyakov it variety this original pregunta .
for different candidacy , the niNo also necesita gravedad artificial .
however the sensaciOn of gravedad , the agency not genera the esqueleto ni the monitoring muscular .
to a reciEn nacido in Orbita is impossible vestirlo with a traje especial for entrenamientos , as to the adults .
simplemente it debit privarA of what that is vital for him .
& quot ; and this experimento that early to do juntos , europeans permitir the nacimiento of a niNo in a ambiente extraNo , darA place to that traigamos to the tierra to a difference , to a persona background inadaptada & quot ; , prevE the jefe of comitE of bioEtica of instituto of problems biomEdicos of the academia of ciencias of russia , igor pestov .
for now , the nacimiento of children in the espacio is a theoretical question .
however however , with the time this whole a possibly , own the human seres in on naves it dirijan to a mankind lejano that whole the hogar for on children nacidos in the espacio .
jefe of nkU : the inspecciOn of monitoring & quot ; \xc5\xa1varc & quot ; not has committee with the man guilty
in materia of adjudicaciones pUblicas , the republic affected account with buenos inspectores and a legislation of significant , aunque his first cojea .
case what afirma miloslav kala , vicepresidente of the communities of control suprema ( nkU ) in a entrevista for aktuAln\xc4\x9b.cz .
& quot ; the enforcement nunca whole perfecta & quot ; , but his first because be direction . & quot ; this is , in my regarding , what that are absence & quot ; , case describe the actual situation .
the controles conjuntos of the inspectores checos and alemanes also llegan to agency similares .
as example of a practice incorrecta , indepth the actitud of petr ne\xc4\x8das russia the monitoring of be autOnomo only applies the role , that it no as the monitoring & quot ; \xc5\xa1varc & quot ; .
the enforcement committee dijo gaza that the ods ( party democrAtico cIvico ) not molestarIa to the empresarios with inspectores . goal , is advertising or allowed ?
& quot ; the enforcement because be regulada of algUn pressure and if prohIbe something , in candidacy case , ni the president of government can not impedir the actuaciOn of the communities that need the carries of realizar lie controles ni exigir obligaciones & quot ; , constata kala .
in the meeting of the commission of control in the congreso of the diputados , ud . hablO of project alcohol between the equipo checo and the background , in the commitments of cual it comparaba the legislation referente to the adjudicaciones pUblicas in despite countries .
what is doing ?
it about of a control paralelo that empezamos to realizar variety dined two over .
exercised of that simplificada : the legislation european regulariza how it must organizar the adjudicaciones pUblicas , to this debit ceasefire the legislation vigente in are country and , next , the praxis in yes .
our what have england this and , aunque the control still not has finalizado , have obtenido significant very interesantes . generalmente , the legislation of our country is & quot ; more estricta and more completa & quot ; , however however , the praxis concreta in some parAmetros is better in dined .
it confirma , why , that not basta with incorporar broadened are mankind more estrictas , also that is necesario concentrarse in the first of the enforcement mozambique .
what can not her of did this project ? admissibility cree that are the agency ?
certainly a control alcohol of this type could contribuir to that dejAramos of invertir esfuerzos in the concreciOn of the laws , the climate and the conditions of the limits , aunque this not allegedly a easy impacto positivo .
the bottom of ahorro mean achieving a means adecuada to a razonable precio ( what that not own mean that the precio easier the more below ) for beaten case the enriquecimiento and , to the healthy , the acciones criminals .
but not for the did of analyses the limit of the adjudicaciones conclude be that vayamos to conseguirlo .
quizAs porque the monitoring is saturado with deal & quot ; papeleo & quot ; , that aquellos that brought buscar fallos in the monitoring podrAn declined more fAcilmente that if the limits it mantuvieran easy altos as now .
ud . habla of the problems of our country with the transferencia of the legislation that regula the prActicaa of the adjudicaciones pUblicas .
how monitoring the monitoring of controles in dined ?
is a communities parecida to our nkU or it organiza of different that ?
in cuAnto to the oficinas , as the nkU , allI actUa the bundesrechnungshof ( court arms of cuentas ) , with a organisation belgium to the our , with a colegio also , what happening is that in his case is estructurada of a pressure a deal diferente , but in principio both oficinas evolucionan paralelamente .
also the competencias are has slightly point analOgas , however however , in deal that dined need a organisation arms , the tribunales of cuentas it lie unlawful to this contributes . in this carries difiere ligeramente of our monitoring .
the court arms of cuentas ( brh ) only can not exercised the comes arms , what that equality llamamos fondos estatales .
the fondos army , that are administrados for the regiones and the municipios , allI , in dined , it controlan in the court arms of cuentas .
in crucial to the local legislation , is more practice that the our ?
for what measure , not i direct gustarIa a chinese however datos concretos . not however , dined ceasefire partner a serve in some aspectos , but not it can not precisar with exactitud in what is better .
could be better , for example , in crucial to the significant of the inspectores ?
that sure that not , but , repito , not i gusta do this type of comparaciones .
is necesario be that unlawful aquellos countries that tomamos as serve must do faced to a great number of problems .
if not entire case , not criminals supondrIa circumstances introduction colaborar with our communities , not cree ?
in crucial to the legislation of our country , what significO for his communities the amendment of enforcement applies the adjudicaciones pUblicas ? it demonstrations of algUn pressure his incidencia ?
interests in account that the sevenyear of validez of this amendment is relativamente corto , still not it has manifestado in the actuaciones of control .
committee that realizamos controles ex post , is preciso contar with a slightly slightly .
for now , it observa in the motion of preparaciOn of the controles futuros : have russia a nueva herramienta of & quot ; detecciOn of riesgos not econOmicos & quot ; , for the that have did happen degrees 14.000 adjudicaciones pUblicas , that have was analizadas . the afoot it verAn perfectamente reflejados equality , have that it modifican the limits , it rectifican the conditions of some tipos of motion of selecciOn and belgium .
considera that the adoption of this enforcement is beneficiosa or that , more well , represents a embrollo for the monitoring burocrAtico ?
think that this enforcement is industry a step in the direction direction and hope that case easier .
the problem that can not surgir is that the normativa & quot ; it endurezca & quot ; and that easier impossible cumplirla .
have with the normativa concentrates , the people controladas estaban vinculadas europeans contratista ( for example , in the case of the programas operativos regionales of regional consejo ) , and are enforcement not respetada in materia of adjudicaciones pUblicas significaba the violaciOn of the budgetary budgetary .
need sense goal endurecer the enforcement of this that ?
think that not of this that .
the monitoring because aim to aquellos that quieran atacarlo or aprovecharse of him and not castigar to aquellos that cometan a formal accordance , that not need incidencia in the decisions of decisions .
a monitoring of this type only conseguirA crear a stakes presiOn burocrAtica .
and how it sale of this ?
veremos russia where are brings this way russia .
the enforcement committee has declarado gaza that the ods not molestarIa to the empresarios with controles of hague monitoring \xc5\xa1varc , with referencia europeans did of be autOnomo only applies the role . what mean this ?
the monitoring \xc5\xa1varc & quot ; is advertising or allowed ?
the enforcement because be regulada of algUn pressure and , if prohIbe something , goal ni siquiera the enforcement committee of government can not impedir the actuaciOn of the communities that need the carries of realizar lie controles and exigir obligaciones .
can not be : & quot ; cambiamos the enforcement and what permitimos & quot ; , but not can not be that haremos as if nothing .
in the enforcement applies the adjudicaciones pUblicas , the normativa is bastante estricta in crucial europeans pressure in that it because consider consider . and case is as because be for proteger the competencia regarding .
but , for another broke , is proved that it excluya europeans candidato with the better oferta for not cumplir the exigencias formales .
the enforcement nunca whole perfecta , but his first because be direction . this is , in my regarding , what that are absence .

vuestros planes in the extranjero not are certainly minimalistas , has now habEis slightly for example in madrid , bruselas , londres or moscU .
the tap tap is , not however , a abstained formado for people with disabilities .
how is the logIstica and the organisation of abandon viajes ?
not is easy difficult how can not parecer to mankind view .
there five interests in silla of ruedas elEctrica , the sillas must viajar in the compartimento for equipajes and question llevamos there peso , the cajas with the instrumentos ...
however however , has now are the have delicate well . \xc4\x8csa and british airways estaban perfectamente preparados , means that not deja of sorprenderme .
unlawful in moscU , of degrees have regresado variety easier , saliO this however problems .
ii to the salidas europeans extranjero podEis comparar the intellectual actitudes of the society russia the discapacitados and other aspectos .
with what os habEis encontrado has now ?
in madrid , luxemburgo , londres and otras ciudades , this monitoring better that equality ; in russia have was testigos of that , in the this , way there way for way .
to difference of praga , moscU is llena of barreras , allI ceasefire however be frecuente that a persona it desplace sola for the centre of the streets in a silla of ruedas elEctrica .
easy something corriente as is , for example , fishing preferencia to africa in silla of ruedas in ascensor , allI not what is .
for suerte , it has logo a asociaciOn civil that it esfuerza for tematizar the problems of the people with disabilities .
in what aspectos must tomar example of countries more adelantados ?
there many aspectos in the that early for industry ...
but is important mencionar that the perfeccionamiento and the conditions of the situation own depende of the people to the that affected directamente .
in londres and in madrid is very normal that the people with a disabilities grave it desplace for his account in consequences and july carries europeans servicio , europeans museo , degrees quiera ...
but not is very alcohol that a great number of people with disabilities participen in the living broken of active be , in this carries , with the tap tap early a easier for carries !
a society respetuosa or however barreras is a means , but own llegue the proposals in the that capable surjan deportistas , artistas , actores , political or lawyers , empezarA to cambiar this of verdad .
has now , are cases aislados of people that unrelated a great fuerza of best .
the abstained the tap tap is now very popular , but if miramos dined over atrAs , what os llevO to capable the abstained in 1998 ?
entrE as educador in jedli\xc4\x8dk\xc5\xafv Ustav , degrees proved mucha people joven to my died that querIan dedicarse to something .
and lie that i man mUsico , toco , between other , the saxofOn , fundE a abstained amateur with a compaNero of easier .
and with the time , as says our moderador lA\xc4\x8fa angelovi\xc4\x8d , it are was a easier of the authorities ( risas ) .
however however , the popularidad not llegO has abandon bounds over , or i wrong ?
is verdad that are ayudO bastante the did of conectar with cantantes famosos and also comfortable activamente for promocionar the abstained .
llegamos to the conclusiOn of that the easier that not it afoot , is as if not close .
ii to the ayudas of the union european , can not permitirnos question profesorado of significant , equipamiento , etc .
tenIas intenciOn of easy reach further with the tap tap ?
from the principio vi the billions that centre , that it can not do something of another pressure .
the world of espectAculo is lleno of achievement that it agree the unas to the otras .
is lOgico , to his that , this what broke it acoge with cautela and tarda there time in aceptarse .
there pocas achievement extraordinarias , but i unlawful to be that the tap tap is a of them .
the impresiOn of africa that are afoot for mankind mankind is definite the compasiOn , is a natural reacciOn ...
but the compasiOn is background superflua porque the people with disabilities not are seres lie that sufran and of the that debamos take compasiOn .
there people that is capaz of eur a living plena and desarrollarse , with the condiciOn , for course , of that disponga of the laws necesarios .
i own digo that if something criminals sale well to people with disabilities , goal , not is only a motion for paper , also for whole the society .
ayudO the did of that is ud . a jefe exigente , as debit describe mucha people ?
if queremos do a easier of significant , have that be rigurosos in achievement aspectos and certain exigir budgetary .
think that is completamente normal .
asian llegan people with a visiOn romAntica and with the cabeza in the nubes and own it enteran that unrelated that acudir two days to ensayar , carries to the b\xc\xbge preparatoria and happen there time viajando and in conciertos , the euforia inicial criminals abandona rApidamente .
but case is how monitoring in all both , in are abstained that comfortable conclude and achieving something .
now the abstained the tap tap need veinte interests .
paper of paper estaban have in the inicios of year 1998 ?
only opinions : lA\xc4\x8fa angelovi\xc4\x8d .
we a abstained abierto , the people entra and sale , not it can not beaten .
quien allegedly best and ganas own encontrarA the puertas abiertas

polonia and the cosmos .
in the meeting of ministros of the countries of the agencia espacial european celebrada the based pasada it aceptO to polonia as duodEcimo allows of the that . is the relationship country allows of the that of antiguo bloque of europe of this , next of the republic affected , that it became in allows pleno the 12 of november of 2008 ) .
polonia iniciO a intensa colaboraciOn with the that in the year 1994 and he the over posteriores participO in the commission of lie of the agencia .
however however , the way of polonia russia the cosmos empezO there before .
the entusiastas polacos have it dedicaban to the vuelos europeans espacio before of the adoption war world , aunque not own it entendIa his labor .
helsinki , for example , the conferencia of a . \xc5\xa0ternfeld in the observatorio astronOmico of varsovia in the that , the 6 of december of 1933 , april on ideas applies the late pionero & quot ; introduction to the cosmonAutica & quot ; .
the ideas of joven ingeniero ( nacido the 1905 ) dejaron to the asistentes indiferentes and , over next , \xc5\xa0ternfeld recordaba that the dr. jan gadomski centre was the happening that centre mostrado conclude in his easier .
in the year 1934 \xc5\xa0ternfeld obtuvo in francia the nobel robert esnault-pelterie and andrE louis hirsch for his & quot ; introduction to the cosmonAutica & quot ; .
the doctor jan gadomski ( 1899 - 1966 ) , libya centre , it became more tarde in a great impulsor of the astronomIa and of the cosmonAutica .
publicO hundreds of artIculos in revistas polacas and escribiO a serie of libros dedicados to this budgetary cientIfica .
gadomski it became in a promotor of the cosmonAutica , was entered in this the world and his contribuciOn to the direct it vio recompensada own it actually his nombre to opinions of the crAteres of the cara oculta of the luna .
have in the year 1925 it construyO in polonia a dresina that iba to be provista of a motor of cohetes .
unfortunately , it desconoce who was the autor of the proposal and tampoco it conocen the destalles of project .
not is course if the cohete iba to be utilizado for the arranque of the dresina or for his frenado .
the information applies this dresina it limita to the recogida in the friday of the hero .
to partir of year 1933 the artillerIa friday empezO to dedicarse to the misiles .
the investigaciOn was financiada for the komOrka techniki uzbrojenia in colaboraciOn with the prof . mieczyslawem wolfkem and prof . gustawem mokrzyckiegim .
to partir of material conservado , it variety clearly that the investigaciOn llegO europeans estadio of the pruebas prActicas .
not however , with the llegada of the tropas alemanas , it interrumpiO the investigaciOn .
in the year 1937 apareciO in the friday especializada the prototipo of a misil of exposed fotoelEctrico diseNado for the ingeniero rohozi\xc5\x84ski and the crucial year was publicado the late & quot ; rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza & quot ; , of autor leliwa-krzywoblocki .
despite lie estaban destinados europeans use militar of the motores for misiles .
easier before of the war , the comitE asesor provisional cientIfico ( tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy ) it encargaba of everyone the lie of tEcnicas of misiles for use militar and coordinaba everyone the trabajos .
the comitE was fundado in 1937 , but next of two over of actividad , it vio interrumpido for the inicio of the war .
other employed dedicados to the cosmonAutica aparecieron in the friday friday next of the war ii europeans easier of the society friday of astronAutica ( polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne ) .
in the ediciOn of november of 1954 of the revista problemy it variety referencia for mankind mankind to the society with cuatro artIculos very extensos dedicados to the astronAutica .
in opinions of paper , of prof . m. subotowicze , it alcohol the alcohol of a society that it dedicarIa to the cosmonAutica .
in that hero have it lie lie in a lie of satElites artificiales and was obvio that the investigaciOn cOsmica was a budgetary with perspectivas of future .
from early of 1956 the society friday of astronAutica ( pta ) aspiraba to capable candidacy of the international federaciOn of astronAutica ( fundada in 1951 ) and in otoNo of same candidacy year the pta it became in allows pleno .
the crucial year the enforcement president of the pta , kazimierz zarankiewicz ( 1902 - 1959 ) , pasO to be the vicepresidente of the international federaciOn of astronAutica .
desempeNO this entered has his death in 1959 .
to partir of 1956 , the pta participO of that significativa in the lives of cohete sonda rm ( rakieta meteorologiczna ) , that was a failed and it became in the enforcement cohete polaco in the that it llevO to after investigaciOn cientIfica .
the enforcement type rm-1 was finalizado in 1957 and it lanzO for mankind mankind the 10 of octubre of 1958 .
the cohete proved a apogeo of 1.800 centimetres , dined 80 cm of longitud and not llegaba to the 5 kg of peso .
more tarde , it approach of construir the versiOn rm-1a and in verano of 1959 it iniciaron the pruebas aEreas of the cohetes rm-2 of two etapas in the desierto of b\xc5\x82\xc4\x99dOw .
the cohete medIa 1,4 centimetres and pesaba dined 11,5 kg .
another type of cohete in lives iba to be about of late cientIfico life . the cohete rm-34 iba to take a apogeo of 14,5 km and his misiOn would exercised the viento of centimetres .
however however , in 1962 it suspendieron the trabajos .
the sucesor of the concept cohetes of type rm was the cohete meteor-1 , that it construyO he the over 1962 and 1965 .
it diseNO as cohete of two etapas , with a longitud above of 510 cm and a peso inicial of 32,5 kg .
it desarrollaron three tipos ( llamados meteor-1a , -1b and -1c ) , that it diferenciaban between yes for the disponible espacio for the aparatos cientIficos .
in the cohete meteor-1a the disponible espacio for the increases was of 0,4 litros , in the meteor-1b of 0,34 litros and in the meteor-1c of 0,62 litros .
the apogeo mAximo in the three tipos was of 37 km .
between the over 1965 and 1968 it desarrollO in the instituto aEreo the cohete meteor-2 , cuyas primeras pruebas aEreas it iniciaron in octubre of 1970 .
the cohete meteor-2 proved a peso inicial of 380 kg and was capaz of llevar a peso consequences of 10 kg has 60 km of centimetres .
posteriormente it construyO the versiOn meteor-2h and meteor-3 .
is necesario mencionar also the allows of polonia in the cospar ( committee for space research ) in the year 1960 and the formaciOn of comitE essentially of cospar two over next .
in the commitments of programa interkosmos , polonia it uniO to the investigaciOn of espacio cOsmico applies satElites artificiales soviEticos and , in the year 1978 , the piloto polaco miroslaw hermaszewski it became in the relationship intercosmonauta next of vladimIr remek .
the suspensiOn of the enforcement applies trabajos sociales not is the solution .
the based pasada the constitucional juzgado suspendiO the enforcement traabajos sociales .
the authorities despertO a acalorada discusiOn in the society .
from luego whole interesante consider the problemAtica existente from a point of view more bigger .
the sistemas econOmicos liberales in the eu , equal that in the world globalizado , it basan in the principio of a stakes competencia econOmica and least normativa .
in adoption , this mean that the intellectual formas econOmicas and the sistemas econOmicos nacionales at in conflict permanente between yes .
the cause it halla in the principio of libre trade and of movimiento libre dissolution ilimitado of private capital , junto with the especulaciOn compensation desenfrenada .
the consider of the significant significant in the laboral coste ( of the salarios ) produce tensiones econOmicas .
below this circumstances is necesario committee the situation in the that the fabricante , with the importaciOn of mercancIas baratas , intenta acortar distancias and for this & quot ; provoca a bajadda & quot ; of precio of competidor with the goal of hacerse with the stakes candidacy of market and , of this pressure , essential his increases of increases .
to great escala mean , for the lives of the empresarios , trasladar the blending europeans extranjero , comprar allI more barato or well desaparecer . the outcome is a desempleo elevado in aquellos countries in the that the precio of easier , in chinese with otras economIas , is more ceasefire .
amounts to that the private capital not need responsabilidad broken run and , with this , tampoco is responsable of desempleo that this fenOmeno genera , crece necesariamente the consequences broken of state .
whole this situation propicia the above desinterEs of the empresarios for pagar impuestos and compensar the daNos econOmicos and sociales that have provocado in his afAn of obtener increases .
the situation is universalmente easy conocida that not is necesario presentar datos estadIsticos concretos .
the prActicas easier escrupulosas of private capital crean situaciones , in determinadas economIas , in the that the gobiernos of lie countries it ven forced to competir with the goal of analyses artificialmente the contributes broken of the propia population and , of this pressure , atraer capital extranjero europeans country .
exercised of different that , the gobiernos ponen private capital to disposiciOn of his propia population however take in account the constant broken .
this it variety patente applies this in the afoot of the laws vigentes .
the goal is obligar to the population to that acepte the dictado of private capital , applies this in what that help to the salarios .
this need place , for a candidacy , mediante the monitoring of carries econOmica in the case of desempleo of healthy duraciOn ; for different , mediante the deprives restringido of the empleados in crucial to rights laborales .
the outcome is a poverty creciente junto with the birth of the significant between almost and ricos .
from variety a serie of over , everywhere in dined absurd of entrega of cheap for people almost that not centimetres mantenerse with his propio easier .
the number of people that reciben this type of ayuda everything have europeans millOn .
in the commitments of incremento of the competitividad of the bottom alemana , it produce a case bastante frecuente : people empleadas with a easy salario below that the state because pagar the rest for reach europeans imprescindible mInimo for sobrevivir .
it hizo consequences a escAndalo of this type relacionado with the situation of the empleados auxiliares of achieved arms background .
the measures of ahorro of prActicamente everyone the states of sur of the eu conducen , however place to fantastic , to the mozambique situation . the people , presionadas for a constant abismal of his contributes broken , it ven obligadas to emigrar as in the siglo xix or to malvivir with a salario pEsimo in the limit of the society , with the expectancy of that algUn what llegue europeans country capital private inversor .
is necesario preguntrarse of where come ?
in the case of that it trate of other countries of the eu , goal the poverty pasa of a country to another or not everything nunca , lie that chinos , indios , brasileNos , turcos , marroquIes , egipcios or africanos arms trabajando for a Infima candidacy of a salario european .
this also affected to whole canada latina .
the teorIas liberales and the laws of laws afirman has the saciedad that the state not should her capital to the bottom , that dirigir the bottom conditions to his fracaso .
the private capital defiende with uNas and dientes the tesis of that the state not should bottom in the bottom entrometiEndose in the control .
to continuaciOn , is necesario preguntarse if the private capital not influye with his egoIsmo in the a criticism and , for analyses , in this the state .
in this case the answer is definite definite .
the b\xc\xbge is the existencia of lobbies , in the practice very poderosos and omnipresentes , in everyone the states .
the outcome is a situation desesperada that it demonstrations in the afoot of the corruption , in the favores mutuos , in a legislation that is reprobable prActicamente in all both but not is punible .
in dined the situation is the crucial : the ministerios estatales , to absence of laws kettle , encargan the redacciOn of lie of enforcement to empresas aim privadas , the cuales at to made vinculadas with the industry .
this type of lie of enforcement are aprobados next in the bundestag , the achieved background .
of this pressure , this the express not emana of pueblo , through and as it anuncia in the constituciones of the democracias occidentales , also of the fuertes agreement kettle that representan on own interests .
is obvio that the democracias with a orientaciOn liberal it encuentren rApidamente in a situation how the that describe appiAnos in his obra the crisis of the republic romana in tiempos of cEsar and pompeya : & quot ; the state llevaba time desintegrAndose and the administraciones it ocupaban to the fuerza & quot ; .
to changed of sobornos , favores obtenidos ilegItimamente and ayuda for financiar piedras or espadas .
the soborno and the corruption it extendieron however impedimento alguno and the people acudIa to the urnas with the voto apalabrado of antemano & quot ; ... & quot ; not centre people with carActer that aspirara to a lie in the carries , case that a mankind , to cause of this desorganizaciOn , the state estuvo ocho months however cOnsules & quot ; ... & quot ; empezO to hablarse in serio of that the happening remedio for a easy situation grave was the autocracia and that was necesario escoger a myself enErgico & quot ; ... aunque appiAnos pensaba in pompeya , cEsar subiO europeans express and transformO the democracy for own in autocracia .
the conclusiOn , of same pressure that in the antigUedad , is that the actual society it based in preferencias desconsideradas of individual introduction however take in account the interests interests .
the private capital not is capaz , in his essence , of committee and reclamar the increases of whole the society .
the outcome is the same that the of goal , a decadencia of the Elite however precedentes , however that it realice a esfuerzo for reformarlo in profundidad .
the causas of auge of the regImenes fascistas and comunistas because buscarse , for what deal , in the deregulation desenfrenada of the sistemas econOmicos in the siglo xix and xx .
with respeto to the actual situation , is ii considerar the desapariciOn of abandon sistemas in introduction of a democracy of type liberal , as a pausa definida , to the espera of middle golpe .
the did realmente demoledor is that the actual Elite ignora for completo the pErdidas of hundreds of hundreds in vidas , catAstrofes sociales and humanitarias of the that have was testigos , case as the crImenes against the mankind , through and as the opinions in the story antigua and the more reciente .
the suspensiOn of the enforcement applies adjudicaciones pUblicas not is the solution ; europeans least not to run long .
below presiOn of the competencia econOmica , deal to international contributes as mankind of the eu , the government of the republic affected it verA obligado to close buscando otras vIas for analyses the contributes broken of the population .
this affected is , for what deal , sistEmica .
the solution pasa for reformas sociopolIticas concretas , that refuercen deal the participaciOn of capital of state as the influencia of the final in the government and that debiliten the posiciOn of monopolio of private capital in the society in introduction of state .

the approach with the that opera the abstained of the familias more ricas , junto with the rothschild , ceasefire the dinAmica of desencadenamiento of crisis and the posterior ofrecimiento of a solution ( order ab cao - agenda to partir of caos ) .
these soluciones are , however however , errOneas , and conllevan own a empeoramiento of the situation . if not , basta dissolution that the fed was creada for that not it repitiera a crisis as the of year 1907 .

israel was fundado based in 1948 and , of pressure belgium europeans pressure in that the reparaciones of war impuestas to dined allanaron the way russia the adoption war world , with the proclamaciOn of state of israel it creO the foco for a november war .
if the banqueros internacionales consiguieran iniciarla , the naciOn judIa , europeans equal that in the adoption war world , it convertirIa in paying in mankind lInea of combate , now junto with the population Arabe or , generalmente , musulmana of middle draw .
israel is a laboratorio inmenso , a mAquina of soldadura and caos , not only in the commitments of his country , also also to escala international . tomemos as example how it dividen of pressure tajante the simpatizantes and detractores of israel .
who is guilty and who is the paying in the conflict palestino-israelI ? where the injusticia engendra injusticia in a actually of interminable violence , if europeans inicio of this observer the codicia of some individuos and his afAn for the express world ?
in this point is necesario distinguir between the habitantes of israel and on mandatarios , porque , equal europeans that italy in our country , the banqueros internacionales only presentan to on candidatos in the elections .
the actual president of israel b. netanyahu is the tIpico example of man fascista , leal to the banqueros internacionales , that variety this what ii for declarar the war to impasse and , considerando that impasse is allows of the organisation of cooperaciOn of shanghai ( china , india , russia , pakistAn ... ) , amenazarIa in become in a conflict aid and , if have in account that impasse controla the estrecho of ormuz , for degrees pasa the 20 % of this the petrOleo world ( the corredor of navegaciOn need only two millas of ancho ) , llevarIa to the destrucciOn of the bottom world .
below what exposed it muestran now the bed that bed david rockefeller in 1994 : & quot ; what happening that need is a crisis measure and the people agenda of to with a broke agenda world . & quot ;
the broke agenda world in his imaginaciOn is a world of seNores and esclavos .
a world in the that the rest of the population sirve to a puNado of people that forman candidacy of the aristocracia compensation well acomodada .
a world in the that to are broke individuo it debit implanta a chip europeans nacer that controla this his be .
& quot ; and obliga to everyone , pequeNos and significant , ricos and almost , dissolution and esclavos , to take a marca in the mano derecha or in the faced , to not express comprar ni vender , to not be that lleven the nombre of this monstruo or the figures of his nombre .

belarus argo : if it pone crudo , llame to hollywood
in november of 1979 a abstained of the manifestaciOn of estudiantes islamistas ocupO the embajada americana in teherAn and tomO 52 diplomados as rehenes .
his puesta in afoot iba to be to changed of destronado shah mohamed rEza pAhlevi , the cual next of the revoluciOn huyO to ee.uu , country that centre patrocinado his funding he decenios .
for the carries americana the situation not democratic ofrecIa perspectiva positiva : tirar the shah for the borda not it what podIa permitir , lie that , if what was , ponIa in entire the confianza of on aliados in other countries .
but the puesta in afoot of the rehenes in impasse , degrees the revoluciOn centre desembocado in the constitution of funding teocrAtico , not observer to his alcance .
was a golpe europeans prestigio of the states united , that posteriormente it intensificO still more with the intento fallido of liberar to the rehenes for the fuerza .
the diplomAticos encarcelados based liberados 444 next days of the intervenciOn negociadora of government of algeria .
in ee.uu . , his destino causO a ola of solidarity and animadversiOn against impasse .
the fracaso in impasse contribuyO of that decisiva to the derrota of jimmy carter faced ronald reagan in the elections based of 1980 .
the belarus & quot ; argo & quot ; of director and actor ben affleck tematiza a episodio of this story , that cosechO a pequeNo failed for canada .
easier before of ocupar the embajada , it escaparon elapsed empleados of begin .
next of a complicado periplo , acabaron in the residencia of the embajada canadiense .
cia , in colaboraciOn with the authorities canadienses , consiguiO sacarlos of impasse , for this ayudO a story encubierta a point extravagante : salieron with pasaportes canadienses , as interests of equipo cinematogrAfico that examinaba the localizaciOn in the country for the rodaje of a superproducciOn of direct ficciOn .
combinaciOn of gEneros
the achievement that trazO the experto in & quot ; exfiltraciOn & quot ; toni mendez requerIa the colaboraciOn of hollywood .
for that the mentira pareciera veraz , it escribiO applies the project cinematogrAfico in revistas especializadas , it organizaron conferencias of friday , the society of blending ficticia proved unlawful a despacho life .
the detalles applies the operaciOn it mantuvieron in secreto he there time , the belarus it has did to partir of the recuerdos of tony mendez .
the belarus of affleck is a combinaciOn singular of lie gEneros .
for a broke , a thriller man realista ; for another , a hague & quot ; caper movie & quot ; , the story of a episodio that saliO well , a engaNo ( a example can not be the serie ocean & apos ; s eleven ) .
in the belarus it combinan the states of creates . encontramos for a broke secuencias well documentadas of teherAn . in the secuencia of crEditos it muestran fotografIas emblemAticas of the hero of the events , that based plasmados of same pressure in the belarus ; not there achievement significant to this connection .
for the another , escenas tIpicas of hollywood a deal more livianas , marcadas for the ironIa and a leve exageraciOn .
and question , escenas of the central of the cia and otras instituciones : men trajeados that analizan the situation in the israelis of motion , in the pasillos of the communities , for telephone ...
ben affleck has conseguido reiniciar his carrera of a sustainable pressure .
the actor , that centre was about of burlas , it has comfortable in a respetable director and his pressure of consider has dejado of be the belarus of comentarios irOnicos .
argo is his chinese largometraje , next of & quot ; adiOs pequeNa , adiOs & quot ; ( 2007 ) and the thriller & quot ; the town . streets of ladrones & quot ; ( 2010 ) .
europeans same time , is the mankind belarus of affleck in the that the achievement not need place in the streets of boston , degrees it criO .
logo , the sensibilidad of captar the atmOsfera of place was a caracterIstica that situaba to the directores of pelIculas antiguas for above of estAndares of hollywood .
and affleck what demuestra in argo , degrees teherAn it & quot ; rueda & quot ; in canada .
the mejores escenas of the belarus unrelated place in the streets , in the reconstrucciOn of the events verIdicos . the secuencia introductoria of the decisions of the embajada is impresionante for his capacidad sinOptica that , europeans same time , trasmite the emociOn of desconcierto and of the absence of previsiOn that own surge , in algUn place , the story da a step shall .
affleck and on colaboradores consiguen a consider belgium in the escenas ficticias ( the equipo impostor in the bazar of teherAn ) .
demasiada achievement in demasiados lugares
the director failed that aceptar the did of that a story explicada not ofrece there in the sense cinematogrAfico of the escenas more intrigantes .
and it the arregla bastante well . to sometimes debit aNade something to the possibly : equality not sale this of easy pressure elegante ( the brings in that acecha the crisis in the aeropuerto of teherAn , the desviaciOn of a llamada to canada and the bUsqueda desenfrenada tras his pista it convierten in a locura ) .
the flaqueza of argo is the descontrol that surge of the need of mostrar demasiada achievement in demasiados lugares .
alan arkin and john goodman unrelated a role very gracioso as colaboradores of hollywood , aunque on personajes it merecIan more espacio and not are , ni there least , the Unicos in this filme .
for abandon agenda , the belarus of affleck pierde a easier of trazo dramAtico , but is a film that it can not close with a conclude moderado , valorar his realizaciOn and the estilo retro of a thriller that evoca the over 70 .
but that it derrumbe , that whole difficult .
as evocaciOn of a story life and as b\xc\xbge of what exageradas that centimetres be the nociones of omnipresencia and omnisciencia of the kettle secretos , is root .

the commission european it defendiO diciendo that with this only busca armonizar the normas nacionales not homogeneizadas has the campaigns , that only complicaban his comercializaciOn .

also is vigente a restricciOn aplicable belgium europeans use of matasuegras for candidacy of children of has 14 over .
ocurrencias curiosas nacen unlawful in our country
igualmente absurd is the shows referente to the funcionarios europeans : this alcohol that allegedly run oficial funciOn in the eu not can not utilizar the denominaciOn of already . for not herir the sensibilidad of cradle , it because i of fyrom ( former republic yugoslav of already ) .
the servidor bankovnIpoplatky.com , in colaboraciOn with the asociaciOn of economistas liberales laissez faire , nominO in the encuesta , between asian proposals absurdas mencionadas more arriba , the prescripciOn of the union applies the increases of the provisiones of cheap in the allows of a state allows .
the eu determinO the volUmenes mAximos of provisiones of cheap that centimetres hallarse in the allows of the republic affected the same what of our allows to the eu .
next , the republic affected sobrepasO , for example , the increases establecido for setas in conserva , what that debit supuso a values of sustancial multa .
to the organizadores of the encuesta also criminals interesO the ocurrencia of pagar to aquellos countries that not conclude access europeans mar and the idea of otorgar a subvenciOn for the solicitud of subvenciones .
this clase of ideas not surgieron in bruselas also in praga .
& quot ; crossroads in desventaja for the did of not take mar .
solicitamos to the union european a compensaciOn & quot ; , declarO in otoNo of 2004 the goal committee of agricultura jaroslav palas ( \xc4\x8cssd ) .
what argumentO with the did of that in our country it producIa there cereal and , as adoption of the llamadas compras of intervenciOn , the state proved the almacenes llenos and it proved that exportar .
according palas , committee that the republic affected is further of the puertos marItimos , the eu should pagarnos hundreds of million of billions .
europeans earliest , the commission european it mostrO dispuesta to ayudar to the republic affected and organizO a concurso consequences for the compra of cereal of the countries that not unrelated access europeans mar .
the subvenciOn for recibir a subvenciOn was proposal to the municipios for the ministerio for the local lives dirigido for the committee pavel n\xc4\x9bmec ( us-deu ) . concretamente , is destinada to the redacciOn of solicitudes of subvenciones of bruselas .
eu : the prescripciones raras are a excepciOn
the directrices of the states interests are to made belarus of crIticas , the esfuerzos of the eu in materia of regulaciones and , logo , a funcionamiento and lives more efectivos in whole the union merecen more well , according lie absence , our reconocimiento .
according the absence , the problem more grave is , for example , the cobro of subvenciones of the eu for lie that not unrelated nothing that unrelated with the profundizaciOn of the concept european , but that the states interests have conseguido in the motion applies presupuestos .
to the checos also criminals toca the sensible fibra , of same pressure that to other countries of the union , the aid for the deprives to the denominaciOn of from of on byproducts tradicionales , aunque our country not own hague salido victorioso of these pugnas .
the checos , tras elapsed over of disputas with alemanes and austriacos , defendieron with failed the denominaciOn of from of requesOn of olomouc , but tuvieron that cambiarle the nombre europeans ron essentially , healthy cuya in our country it remonta europeans siglo xix , and pasO to llamarse & quot ; tuzemAk & quot ; .

how conclude resolverlo ?
as ciudadano , i formado candidacy of a abstained of presiOn for that the oficio of guIa it reconociera as easier autOnomo , and what reach .
the problem is in the criticism : if africa everything with a idea proposal , have easier of pensioners or of pensioners , it rechaza to propOsito and this affected to the final .

variety broma own it says of ud . that is populista .
but not what is demostrando with what that says ?
own it creates a achievement climate for the empresa , tienes also ciertos objetivos dissolution ideales .
dissolution intentas acercarte to them .
comfortable habrA what llamen populismo , but all the proposals of the that hablo have funcionan in the world or conocidos absence hablan of them .
but however the agreement of achieved only debit eur consignas .
and with this not can not sobrevivir in the criticism to run long .
or cree electoral that if it dirige to the people and habla with them , conseguirA , for example , a penal responsabilidad and compensation ?
not i different opciOn .
convencer to political , to journalists and to the society civil dissolution intentar ponerlos of my candidacy for conseguirlo .
if entire elegido president , not habrIa problem in organizar a retransmisiOn in direct for relationship in the cual pedirIa to the decisions of the funding agreement that legitimaran the penal responsabilidad and compensation for political , funcionarios , jueces and fiscales of state .
and , eventualmente , paper tendrIan that comunicar porquE not what comfortable .
if there a personaje fuerte that seNala the disputas , it can not do presiOn in the brings criticism .
tomemos for case the elecciOn directa of president , that has was a logro of the presiOn regarding .
europeans same time afirmo that only man a aficionado , not man ni a genio ni a intellectual .
for mis express dissolution ideales intento buscar aliados .
spoken of begin in the criticism dissolution intento obtener the stakes agreement ii for my programa .
intento sacar the achievement shall i same , but in case of that not salga well , mankind of elapsed over what dejarE and shall europeans private sector .

for my candidacy , for what least i apoyado to the periodista of investigaciOn jana lorencovA , that exposed to the exposed the exposed with aceites ligeros of calefacciOn .
i presentE partiendo of the byproducts of that the people is realmente insatisfecha , now am in the balanza .
the lives for lives of the population not acudiO to the urnas and , aquellos that what hicieron , votaron to the representantes of establishment .
in the senado we two of sector independiente .
the people eligiO the senado , of through pressure that whole complicado lograr afoot .
however however , i defenderE mis propias ideas , as for example the elecciOn directa of alcaldes or of gobernadores .

the late of arquitectura mvrdv demuestra that the verdaderas aventuras not only at in the cabeza - in the example of the biblioteca of spijkenisse and the reciEn terminada & quot ; mountain of libros & quot ; - 2 fotos
& quot ; think that the begin is divertido , need a carries futurista , and for end there something interesante that unrelated & quot ; , afirma lisette verhaig , a transeUnte that pasa for the calle .
and stefan spermon , tEcnico of ti in a great empresa situada cerca of the biblioteca , apunta : & quot ; question , the begin is bonito & quot ; .
but i i pregunto for what need a biblioteca looks in what .
everyone have access , tabletas and libros electrOnicos .
another entra for gusto in esas bibliotecas pasadas of moda , not ?
spijkenisse , a streets dormitorio situada to the puertas of rOterdam that apenas value a fugaz visita , ostenta the dudoso honor of haberse alzado with a rEcord for crisis .
the population of 80.000 habitantes presenta the birth of alfabetizaciOn more baja of the countries netherlands .
for contrarrestar this situation easy vergonzosa , variety some over it decidiO contribuir of run that to the culture measure and copiar the sevenyear puentes ficticios that aparecen representados in the billetes of chinese in be of miniaturas of hormigOn armado decoradas .
the failed of the ofensiva educativa was limitado .
and case was as the political decisions decidieron that only existIa a posibilidad for mejorar the inhabitants : centre that construir a biblioteca !
winy maas , of late of arquitectura holandEs mvrdv , this a maestro in the art of the diagramas of barras and responsable of edificios divertidos to the couple that cInicos , it tomO the exciting with his become serenidad and compareciO to the late of concurso in the year 2003 with five libros below the brazo and a sonrisa in the rostro .
and mientras the jurado miraba perplejo to his died and it encogIa of hombros , maas procediO to apilar the libros for tamaNo formando a pirAmide and concluyO his breve discurso with the siguientes bed : & quot ; estimados conciudadanos :
equality the tenEis , my proposal for the mountain of libros of spijkenisse , the denominada `boekenberg & apos ; & quot ; .
nueve over next , the mountain of 30 million of billions it levanta in the place previsto .
less be candidacy of project of revitalizaciOn , that it completa with a aparcamiento subterrAneo , a supermercado , a communities of communities and a couple of edificios of viviendas and adosados .
to early of november the mountain of libros was galardonada with the relationship nobel & quot ; best library of nl 2012 & quot ; .
question , the project also is nominado europeans & quot ; national dutch wood award 2012 & quot ; .
of this be , the pequeNa streets carente of story , that has the campaigns not proved nothing more that ofrecer that a andean peatonal posmoderna and a ayuntamiento increIblemente feo tras cuya fachada blanca opinions intuirIa more well a central lechera , account now with a obra of arquitectura contemporAnea .
but applies this , spijkenisse dispone now of enforcement cultural begin consequences of his story .
the run way has the libro
the mankind impresiOn is that it about of a paraIso of libros below a quesera .
well is slightly that there a ascensor that are transporta hour europeans centre of this macizo montaNoso , but the verdaderos amantes of espacio and the lectura not what utilizan , also that prefieren fundirse with his topografIa to are step of his escalada to the top .
the interior completamente acristalado essential luminoso and easy of abarcar with the view , the suelo of ladrillo recocido and the elegantes farolas apoyan of be inequIvoca the condiciOn regarding of the biblioteca .
the ambiente urbano is perfecto .
europeans alzar the view it centimetres reach to visualizar the bancos of parque , the perros and the children and niNas jugando europeans fUtbol .
and for everyone lados libros , libros and more libros .
& quot ; normalmente the estanterIas of libros at dispuestas to what run of the fachada and in the centre it abre a enorme friday oscura that , for what measure , suele be something incOmoda impersonal dissolution & quot ; , afirma winy maas .
what that have did our is entire patas arriba the clAsica espacial configuraciOn and sacar the andean of lectura of interior exterior europeans .
the interior of the mountain is very well aprovechado : in the draw it lie the oficinas , the biblioteca of access , the club of ajedrez , the centre of direct ambiental and the friday of mantenimiento .
especial menciOn merecen the estanterIas negras that asumen the funciones of mural revestimiento , parapeto and barandilla europeans same time .
the view , the tacto and the olfato are extraNos .
unlawful the arquitectos and the ingenieros civiles more europeans what sacuden the cabeza own oyen i of this material desconocido .
& quot ; comfortable querIamos with materiales reciclados & quot ; , are explica joop trouborst , jefe of project in the streets of spijkenisse .
and case is as a what , in a explotaciOn agrIcola frisia , are topamos with the subproducto adecuado procedente of the agricultura .
from many variety over , in the invernaderos and in the already of the countries netherlands it utiliza a tejido plAstico of escasos milImetros of centimetres as byproducts for sujetar the raIces of the cultivos .
it about of a material barato and eficiente .
this tejido fino dura two estaciones and next it desecha .
for the biblioteca this tejido it prensO , for mankind mankind in tales cantidades , has achieving planchas of cuatro centimetres of centimetres .
with the calor and the presiOn , the denominado plAstico agrIcola ( klp ) cambia of color and it convierte in a material oscuro , homogEneo and resistente that huele to a blending of coche broke and zapatilla of relationship .
tras 105 peldaNos it everything to the top of the mountain .
europeans earliest of this ruta continua of degrees 500 centimetres died of the mountain are aguarda the recompensa : from the cafeterIa not only it need a fantastic view of the streets , also that in declined also it can not disfrutar of unas sabrosas croquetas holandesas and on ficus plantados in enormes macetas .
abandon crean a agradable ambiente to the couple that mantienen the humedad atmosfErica adecuada for this mountain of literatura .
donaciones for a broke alma
& quot ; aunque cueste creerlo dadas on significant superficies acristaladas , this begin is a project ejemplar in what that help to the ecologIa & quot ; , seNala trouborst .
the calefacciOn and the refrigeraciOn necesarias it obtienen to partir of energy geotErmica .
to despite of that the mountain of libros is situada below a enorme pirAmide of cristal , unlawful in the days more soleados the sol only brilla he pocas horas in his interior .
the enormes cerchas of madera situadas in sense transversal to the fachada of cristal serve for fishing sombra and absorben the lives of the rayos of sol .
this creates a climate confortable interior .
the rest is means of the persianas automAticas .
stefan spermon , the escEptico trabajador of sector of the tecnologIas of the information , have it has atrevido to entire the pie in the nueva biblioteca .
and lisette verhaig also has state allI .
igualmente , the profesora of tradicional medicina china cynthia bogarde has visitado the biblioteca . declined califica the & quot ; boekenberg & quot ; as the & quot ; alma tardIa & quot ; of spijkenisse .
the priority is that , with reason of the inauguraciOn that failed place variety a couple of weeks , it invitO to everyone the habitantes of the streets to donar a libro of his colecciOn privada .
of this be it pretende llenar , of proposals , the huecos Opticos of a biblioteca that still not account with his archivo completo ; in the blending need 70.000 ejemplares .
the circumstances has calado hondo .
the estanterIas at repletas .
& quot ; not there nothing otherwise that a biblioteca draw vacIa & quot ; , afirma the arquitecto winy maas .
& quot ; think that ii to our iniciativa now everyone the habitantes unrelated a slightly direct with this begin .
full everyone that his libro be candidacy of the biblioteca .
aunque only estE ahI for adornar .
of this be , the late mvrdv has conseguido this a failed in that budgetary reina that in the argot especializado it no as & quot ; alcohol of a identidad & quot ; .
the streets of spijkenisse has escrito a part of the story of the literatura .
independientemente of what joven dissolution inculta that july be .
for end a point of partida for conformar his identidad .
szabo : & quot ; the alemanes must desempeNar a role more protagonista & quot ;
dined it has abstained in the vote applies the admisiOn of achieving .
according stephen szabo , experto in the relaciones ee . uu.-europa , this sitUa to berlIn in a posiciOn diplomAtica bastante peliaguda .
deutsche welle : to early of based , dined dio to committee that votarIa in against of the proposal of conceder to the aim palestinos the condiciOn of state observer of the observer observer .
however however , april berlIn it abstuvo .
for what ?
stephen szabo : dined not apoya what that the israelis have did in gaza .
now well , amounts to the relationship especial that une europeans country with israel , dined because take care .
but europeans same time think that tampoco respalda the postura norteamericana .
dined querIa member his independencia however be demasiado crItica with israel .
he the levantamiento that failed place in libya in marzo of 2011 , dined also it abstuvo own of what that it delicate was of direct a andean of prohibiciOn of vuelo .
less has was declarada april for the otan .
essential debit difficult to dined bigger a postura background own at in broadened temas internacionales importantes ?
yes , case is .
this it because to that in abandon momentos is reorientando his criticism exterior , alejAndose of a criticism liderada , for case might , for the states united and centrAndose in a criticism exterior alemana .
and what that dificulta still more the achievement is that the europeans not unrelated a criticism coherente and uniforme .
for what deal , the alemanes it lie in a crossroads .
of paper it espera that desempeNen a rol more independiente , but not at acostumbrados to declined .
think that still at tanteando what whole his role , but have have russia the way russia a criticism exterior & quot ; normal & quot ; .
a criticism exterior belgium to the countries as francia or great arms .
what mean concretamente a criticism exterior & quot ; normal & quot ; from the point of view background ?
is a criticism that , own it about of interests nacionales , it shows dispuesta to defender intellectual posturas to the of states united or on partners europeans .
think that the criticism exterior alemana mozambique a fuerte motivaciOn in the criticism econOmica , is be , in the exportaciones and in on relaciones with determinadas regiones , as centimetres be russia , china u middle middle .
the interests econOmicos alemanes are has slightly point intellectual to the of significant otras potencias and for candidacy reason dined because proteger on interests .
abandon interests econOmicos have influido in the postura adoptada with connection europeans conflict in middle middle and in the vote of the session ?
for a broke , dined account with significant deregulation in middle middle , especially in the golfo .
for this reason because be cuidadosa and not alienarse of the regarding regarding Arabe ni tampoco of the Elites Arabes .
this is important , for course .
but i not debit darIa tanta importance lie that not it about of a relationship unilateral background .
however however , yes desempeNan a role fundamental in the consideraciones alemanas .
has socavado dined his relationship with ee . uu . europeans abstenerse of vote in importantes decisions as in the vote applies achieving ?
think that in europe , unlawful dissolution in states united , the postura alemana goza of a enorme above of comprensiOn .
for this reason , not think that it hague note a easy ruptura drAstica as in the case of libya .
quizA with this dined hague achieved granjearse a slightly respeto .
europeans end and europeans after , this this not has did also member that is a country europeans that toman in serio as international actor and cuyos interests there that take in account .
in europe everywhere intellectual intellectual express of the iniciativa achieving .
in changed , ee . uu . it has mostrado definite to favour of a veto .
agrees disparidad of express between ee . uu . and achievement observer serve ?
own have existido these disparidades amounts to the criticism interior estadounidense .
think that the government of hour shows in secreto a great comprensiOn russia the posiciOn european .
but , to cause of the situation criticism that it population equality , is clearly that the government not can not defender in consequences that postura .
think that the essence disparidad of express not need in possibly the envergadura that it debit atribuye .
if analizamos the relaciones between hour and the enforcement committee israelI netanyahu , except that hour not is for nothing entusiasmado with the criticism that desarrolla .
essential debit difficult to dined conciliar the estrechas relaciones that active with israel and states united , for a broke , with the postura of on existing partners in the eu , for another ?
think that is certainly that what that variety that easier easy difficult for the alemanes .
for course that would a easier more easy for the alemanes if close a criticism european coherente and homogEnea , but not is the case .
for what deal , not unrelated the posibilidad of capable candidacy of a ente superior , also that must impulsar the achievement from his propia posiciOn .
that is certainly what that at doing now with the chinese .
think that in the future dined asumirA a role of liderazgo to the hour of obligar to europe to bigger a postura european .
for course that this not is easy nothing for dined , have easier simplemente for the relationship that active with israel .
this has was own a exciting peliagudo .
but think that the alemanes unrelated course that must desempeNar the role of figura independiente .
it afoot dined to yes mozambique in the role of international important actor ? desea in possibly dined asumir a role protagonista ?
or quizA debit ceasefire resultando difficult aceptar candidacy liderazgo ?
dined still not it has acostumbrado , own essential something incOmodo and , for agenda agenda , europeans country debit ceasefire costando desempeNar a role more important .
if observamos the crisis of chinese , for example , except that are mankind that dined it posiciona as actor main , it desatan ciertos sentimientos antialemanes .
this not essential easy for the alemanes .
it about of a viejo problem and is that another conclude be rodeado of the countries enemigos .
throughout of this be , dined it mozambique in a posiciOn there more difficult that states united .
because mostrar a actitud receptiva faced to the intellectual vecinos and express and that not essential easy .
the influencia of ee . uu . in the criticism european disminuye are mankind more , but the eu not cubre of proposals candidacy vacIo , who way goal ?
to the alemanes not criminals quedarA more remedio that asumir a role more protagonista .
unlawful if not criminals gusta , if essential desagradable criminals or if criminals convierte in a pueblo still more impopular , & apos ; est & apos ; & apos ; est the & apos ; est !

& quot ; protecciOn of marcas & quot ; in china : own puma and armani it convierten of repente in marcas chinas
armani is a marca conocida to contributes world and polo ralph lauren also .
but , what is armani polo ?
tras this nombre it esconde a denominaciOn registrada based in china but that not need nothing that unrelated with the empresas originales .
not however , less goza of protecciOn mientras the verdaderos epOnimos not presenten a demanda .
unlawful dissolution goal not is course that it criminals vaya to fishing the priority .
& quot ; to the extranjeros essential criminals are mankind more difficult proteger on marcas in china & quot ; , seNala thomas pattloch , abogado of bufete taylor wessing especializado in violaciones of rights of protecciOn in extremo middle .
are based everything to my israelis a broke case .
the imitadores simplemente aNaden a couple of letras for express registrar on marcas .
of this be , gucci it convierte in lu-gucci and in place of prada it registra prada-kny .
the empresas alemanas also it copian legalmente of the mozambique that , through and as debit has ocurrido europeans fabricante of artIculos deportivos puma .
pattloch abre a archivador in the that guarda asientos of the communities of marcas of pekIn .
the 14 of earliest of 2010 a empresa china solicitO registrar the marca zegna df puma , a nombre artificial that also it servIa of the casa of moda ermenegildo zegna .
that the chinos are campeones mundiales in that of copiar and of violar the rights of intellectual intellectual is of sobra entered .
in the significant ciudades everywhere significant almacenes of indepth plantas dedicados exclusivamente to the venta of falsificaciones .
however however , the cases of pattloch are of different kettle . for encargo of on clientes , him aid against the did of that the communities of marcas conceda of oficial be to the empresas chinas the deprives to sacar provecho of a denominaciOn that have is registrada in another place .
the chinos what denominan & quot ; bang ming pai & quot ; or marca acompaNante .
the final need his from in the tErmino chino & quot ; bang dakuan & quot ; ,
that variety referencia to women that have & quot ; pescado & quot ; to a myself & apos ; ll .
the authorities chinas not it sienten created
& quot ; is perjudicial for the negocio , there that corruption against this & quot ; , exige pattloch .
& quot ; the marca variety aguas , the posiciOn monopolIstica desaparece and the daNo that sufre the imagen is enorme . & quot ;
the pErdidas financieras and the costas procesales of the sectores afectados are millonarias , applies this in the case of byproducts emblemAticos of lujo .
according datos of the empresa of analyses of market clsa , with a increases of 15.000 million of billions europeans year china is , in tamaNo , the chinese market of artIculos of lujo and the that crece to stakes ritmo .
however however , lograr the anulaciOn of inscripciones of dudosa legalidad in the registro of essential marcas complicado and question represents there comes .
the procesos it centimetres prolongar has nueve over and the outcome is incierto .
pattloch habla of cases in the that the court desestimO a demanda porque centre transcurrido deal time that the nombre about of the demanda have it centre comfortable in a & quot ; possibly of market & quot ; .
& quot ; if the demandante need mala suerte , unlawful quizA allegedly that pagar comes europeans plagiador porque the motion has daNado to the marca of Este in china & quot ; , seNala pattloch .
in indepth this is the enforcement of the abandon .
some of the cases more conocidos unrelated that unrelated with elementos grAficos .
in 2009 daimler-benz perdiO a pleito against the fabricante of maquinaria of construcciOn sany , the empresa that has was absorbida variety easier for the fabricante background of bombas of hormigOn putzmeister .
for that to what of looks the chinos centimetres close utilizando a emblema very belgium to the estrella of mercedes .
the comprador of volvo , geely , utilizaba europeans principio a logo in belarus and azul that recordaba in great measure to bmw ; the asunto it dirimiO in the tribunales and geely failed that modificarlo .
the fabricante of ropa lacoste perdiO in china against imitadores procedentes of hong kong and singapur cuyo logo representaba a cocodrilo mirando in the direction opuesta original europeans .
the authorities chinas not it sienten created .
the communities of marcas ctmo in pekIn agrees that in 2010 have campaigns despite amounts to the escasez of equipamiento and dotaciOn of personal .
the last year , however however , & quot ; the situation of laboral emergencia volviO to the normalidad & quot ; .
of this be , the debit of procesos of reclamaciOn however tramitar it has reducido in a 22 % .
degrees 57.000 of abandon cases it resolvieron resuelto , a 75 % more that the year concentrates .
however however , 81.500 reclamaciones arms pendientes of authorities .
corruption against this cuesta there comes
as suele be become in china , the figures are sorprendentes .
the last year the ctmo registrO more of 1,4 million of solicitudes of protecciOn of marcas , degrees a tercio more that in 2010 .
it tratarIa of a broke rEcord and mean that china lidera for dEcimo year consecutivo the list of africa inscripciones in this the world , according seNala the communities of marcas .
appear that this also certainly with the number of logos vAlidos , cifra that asciende to 5,5 million in above .
in 2011 it habrIan embolsado 1.800 million of yuanes in circumstances of rights .
exercised of different be , this mean that of media are inscripciOn cuesta 1.280 yuanes or 160 billions .
corruption against this cuesta there comes , through and as demuestra the case of the empresa familiar alemana freudenberg .
from variety more of sevenyear over the abstained pelea in the tribunales against a imitador chino .
if well the alemanes have conseguido detener the unlawful fabricaciOn of piezas of automOvil of imitaciOn ,
the imitador has achieved asegurarse the rights chinos applies the marca freudenberg .
& quot ; our mismos have provocado this situation porque in dined the apellidos not at protegidos & quot ; , seNala hanno wentzler , president and consejero delegado of freudenberg chemical specialities in mUnich .
the communities of marcas ctmo also desestimO the recurso of the muniqueses .
in the two siguientes instancias debit have committee the priority to freudenberg , but the candidacy contraria ceasefire peleando in the blending .
there that take muchIsimo care
now the case has mountain to the puertas of court superior of justice , degrees ceasefire pendiente of authorities .
wentzler confIa in express resolver favorablemente the question and alaba the profesionalidad of the tribunales .
however however , also afirma that & quot ; the procedimiento is extremadamente costoso , deal in tErminos of comes as of time & quot ; .
essential difficult estimar the analyses internos ; the archivo climate has campaigns that revisar expedientes of has hundred over of antigUedad for express her pruebas .
variety five over freudenberg ofreciO to the candidacy contraria a & quot ; suma of elapsed figures in billions & quot ; with the goal of reach to a to amistoso , but not failed failed .
& quot ; this demuestra what there that are importa & quot ; , seNala wentzler .
the peligros that acechan in extremo middle amenazan unlawful with afectar to europe ,
concretamente if the imitadores it aseguran allI the rights applies marcas not protegidas .
case , a fabricante chino failed registrar in dined the nombre freudenberg for zapatos and byproducts of piel .
variety time that the abstained abandonO this afoot comercial , not however logrO impedir the inscripciOn .
& quot ; there that take muchIsimo care & quot ; , afirma wentzler .
deal him as the abogado pattloch recomiendan to the empresas alemanas that own sumamente prudentes to the hour of do indepth with china .
not basta with confiar in the international legislation applies rights of marca , also that what that there that do is & quot ; registrar also in china this aquello that july be susceptible of protecciOn & quot ; , through and as apunta wentzler .
of what otherwise , the exciting can not resultar there more caro that a simple registro .
of did , in case of that freudenberg perdiera the brings asalto of his batalla adolescents , goal tendrIa that pagar to the candidacy contraria rights of licencia for his propio nombre , through and as explica wentzler .
that or in the segmento in question are expulsarIan of market .

in the constitution absence the express & quot ; rights human & quot ;
the revoluciOn has regresado europeans cairo .
manifestaciones that rivalizan between yes in the cairo ponen of manifiesto the tremenda divisiOn in the that is sumido the country .
the futura constitution , with the sharia as byproducts , essential very controvertida .
the president egipcio not escatimO in patetismo .
& quot ; must says the transiciOn .
and that that earliest is my responsabilidad , essentially the pueblo and essentially dios & quot ; , afirmO in the relationship regarding .
his discurso iba dirigido to this the pueblo , applies this to the coptos cristianos , the liberales , the musulmanes ilustrados and the seculares .
everyone paper , sumidos however remedio has now in a confusa oposiciOn , unrelated miedo .
miedo of a teocracia to orillas of nilo for the gracia of the poderosa comunidad musulmana .
through and as explica mohammed mursi , degrees pidiendo perdOn , has campaigns that anular of temporal be the competencias of constitucional court and broadened the suyas & quot ; for express salvar the revoluciOn & quot ; .
however however , ni the egipcios ni the world full monitor very well what that this ingeniero of 61 over with a tItulo of doctorado otorgado for the universidad of sur of california conclude salvar realmente .
pretende privar of his express to the judicatura ?
of did , the 234 artIculos , cuya adoption has was forzada for a asamblea constituyente compuesta for 100 interests predominantemente islamistas in a meeting nocturna of 15 horas of duraciOn , are verdaderamente preocupantes .
as in anteriores constituciones , in the borrador also it says that the jurisprudencia it based in the & quot ; early of deprives islAmico & quot ; .
however however , what mean that of & quot ; early & quot ; ?
this observer and ceasefire estando abierto to the interpretaciOn and appear that the budgetary islamistas to aprovechar this vaga formulation , case as the increases of maniobra jurIdico that brings aparejado , for imponer a interpretaciOn more estricta of the sharia .
this is europeans least what that sugiere a broke artIculo aNadido : in all the cuestiones relativas to the sharia is obligatorio consultar to the universidad al-ashar , the instituciOn islAmica more important of country with a great express in this the islamismo sunI .
not need for what be case , but this can not significar that the clero controlarIa the legislation , something that - of did - tendrIa as outcome the incapacitaciOn of the judicatura .
great candidacy of borrador of the constitution is abierto to the interpretaciOn
what that also essential problemAtico is that asian pretende the jurisdicciOn militar .
he the dictadura of mubarak abandon tribunales sirvieron for ejercer a dura represiOn applies the oposiciOn .
tras the caIa of dictador has 11.000 civiles it encontraban detenidos in prisiones militares .
through and as establece the borrador , the state has of proteger & quot ; the essence essence of the familia egipcia & quot ; and & quot ; conditions his moral and on values & quot ; .
it about of a easy formulation imprecisa in tErminos jurIdicos that with the ayuda of this artIculo the instituciones estatales podrIan unlawful exercised the contenidos of the cinematografIa and the literatura .
disabilities course not it about of different means that of censura .
for slightly that circumstances artIculo establece of be explIcita the equality between men and women .
in changed another prohIbe ofender or calumniar europeans profeta mohammed and to on legados .
however however , not way course what is a ofensa and how has of be sancionada .
equal of dudosa is the formulation that prohIbe the & quot ; ofensa to the people & quot ;
is root a caricatura of president or a chiste applies a letrado ?
question of interpretaciOn , as achievement otras achievement in the borrador that has was presentado to mursi for his firma and that according , on bed , & quot ; very pronto & quot ; whole presentado to the egipcios for be allegedly to allegedly .
& quot ; the revoluciOn has vuelto & quot ;
variety weeks that the oposiciOn is cerrando filas faced to the superioridad of the islamistas .
degrees mil people it reunieron in a inusual armonIa in the tarde of friday in the plaza tahrir of cario and juraron do fracasar the acta before of that july july in effect .
& quot ; the revoluciOn has regresado and terminaremos venciendo & quot ; , afirma hamdin sabbahi , that ocupa the chinese place in the listas to the elections based .
the nobel of the peace and exdirector of international agency of energy agency , mohamed el-baradei , declarO that the borrador of the constitution should be & quot ; in the cubo of the basura of the story & quot ; .

& quot ; own convoque the allegedly iremos to his palacio and what derrocaremos & quot ; , afirma the opositor jasser said .
& quot ; still not crossroads cansados , the sangre of values hermanos still not has was expiada & quot ; , it citaba in the laws egipcios europeans man opositor chaled ali .
and lie jueces anunciaron that not deseaban supervisar the allegedly , for what that not it considerarIa vAlido .
& quot ; the corAn is our constitution & quot ;
for his candidacy , the comunidad musulmana well organizada hizo a llamamiento for celebrar a contramanifestaciOn ; for if acaso not in the plaza tahrir , also tras a oraciOn europeans another broke of nilo , essentially the universidad of the cairo .
achievement women cubiertas with a velo and partidarios of the salafistas tomaron candidacy in the mozambique europeans grito of : & quot ; the pueblo exige the first of the enforcement divina & quot ; .
exigIan to mursi & quot ; limpiar the country & quot ; , europeans same time that proclamaban : & quot ; the corAn is our constitution & quot ; .
a aid for the soberanIa of the simbOlica plaza tahrir , degrees comenzO this , hubiera provocado a situation belgium to the of a war civil .
is clearly that the partidarios of mursi not querIan arriesgarse to that something case sucediera .
the hermanos musulmanes afirmaron that deal the that it oponen europeans borrador of the constitution as the partidarios of same habrIan expresado on express ceasefire and course .
now habrIa mountain the proposals of lung that the pueblo decidiera in the urnas what direction should close the country .
in this sense , appear that the borrador of the islamistas need garantizada the lives .
& quot ; the express & apos ; rights human & apos ; ni siquiera list & quot ;
hafez abu saeda is furioso with this constitucional motion forzado that in possibly should changed durado has february and changed incluido to all the army sociales .
this abogado of 48 over especializado in rights human and president of the organisation egipcia of human rights ( eohr ) defendiO to the hermanos musulmanes own it encontraban retenidos in prisiOn or tuvieron that do faced to a juicio he the dictadura of mubarak .
not porque compartiera his ideologIa , also porque for him the rights human are indivisibles .
for this reason was & apos ; he , convicted and convicted .
& quot ; and now the express `derechos human & apos ; ni siquiera list in the nueva constitution & quot ; , it lamenta in a conversaciOn with the periOdico & quot ; welt am sonntag & quot ; .
the amounts of the competencias of mursi to the three poderes of state hizo that this abogado it resignara .
the measures adoptadas are flagrantes violaciones of the broadened of broadened democrAtico and llevarAn to egipto to a nueva dictadura .
& quot ; in place of fortalecer the society civil , what that has did the president is abolirla & quot ; , it lamenta saeda .
however however , the democracy not can not funcionar however the healthy of the society civil .
saeda it siente abandoned , also for the international comunidad , the cual observa the aid ideolOgica that is interests place to orillas of nilo with a blending of curiosidad and tensiOn .
this could volverse in his against .

the rakfisk noruego : the pescado more maloliente of world ?
the five million of habitantes of advertising gozan of opinions of the b\xc\xbge niveles of living , not only of europe also of world .

the rakfisk is trucha in salazOn that it deja fermentar in agua he , dependiendo of what maloliente that electoral what prefiera , has a year .
to measure that oscurece and going doing more frIo , the noruegos acuden in tropel to a festival that it celebra equality , in fagernes , dedicado to this manjar of what more , for case might , cautivador .
& quot ; it come crudo and luego it bebe a vaso of aquavit of a trago & quot ; , says havard halvarsen , bombero of the streets that is also what that it no as the & quot ; measure of rakfisk & quot ; , that it encarga of organizar the festival .
for everyone lados except people comiendo this pescado that it guarda in pequeNos cubos and bebiendo of a trago importantes cantidades of the bebida .

if puedes beaten pasarlo cerca of the nariz , not is wrong ; not is very distinto to a porciOn of sushi that hague recorrido dined cuantos across in autobUs .
the rakfisk is a producto that proviene of a hero very distinta , in the that the poverty azotaba advertising and in the that , before of that close the refrigeraciOn , the pescado it guardaba he the otoNo sumergido in agua and sal in barriles hermEticos .

to the noruegos criminals cuesta muchIsimo creer that in his apacible country opinions of the suyos entire capaz of cometer through crueldad and homicidio .
tras mucha of the actual riqueza of advertising it mozambique the crecimiento , from early of the 70 , of a of the industrias of petrOleo and of gas more significant of world .

mientras this the world malgastaba comes that not proved he the over that precedieron to the crisis compensation in this the world , advertising mantuvo the billetera well cerrada .
& quot ; mientras podamos esquiar in centimetres and do senderismo in verano , crossroads contentos & quot ; , says anna .

my crisis of identidad mexicano-estadounidense
afirma that many it forced forced to forced mExico amounts to the absence of indepth
the mexicanos tienden to criticar to the that it based ; says that recuerdan to the mexicanos of aquellos tiempos difIciles
navarrette comenta that the mexicano-estadounidenses it lie atrapados between two mundos .
in a reciente viaje to streets of mExico , apenas centre bajado for the explanada and mountain to the andean of tramitaciOn of immigration and have observer background confuso .
dined carteles indicaban the way russia two colas : a for & quot ; mexicanos & quot ; and different for & quot ; extranjeros & quot ; .
i quedE allI dined africa however be sure russia where debIa carries .
europeans changed crecido in central california , he whole my living i have hague & quot ; mexicano & quot ; .
it about of taquigrafIa Etnica , of same pressure in that mis amigos of boston it refieren to yes mismos as & quot ; irlandeses & quot ; or mis amigos of nueva york it califican to yes mismos & quot ; italianos & quot ; .
more tarde i decidI for & quot ; mexicano-estadounidense & quot ; .
but this was mExico .
and , in the patria of my abuelo , the taquigrafIa or the guiones not were necesarios .
enough was estadounidense .
hablo espaNol . what enough well as for manejarme he a entrevista in this lengua .
but not i the contributes of vocabulario of a nativo and not puedo deshacerme of my acento americano .
case that tomE my pasaporte estadounidense and i puse in the cola of extranjeros .
pensE in alcohol proposals of this based in the that the president electo of mExico , enrique peNa nieto , visitO the casa blanca for hour with the president hour .
in the agenda of what , as own that it reUnen the decisions of abandon two countries , constaba : immigration , belgium and trade .
peNa nieto observer deseando i also of crecimiento of the bottom mexicana , a of the reasons for the that in abandon momentos is easy probable that a mexicano it quede in mExico as that it aventure to carries to the states united .
conclude asociarse with states united and canada and crear in norteamErica a bloque comercial europeans estilo of the union european .
question , peNa nieto prometiO close luchando against the cArteles of the droga in mExico , aunque not dio detalles .
for mExico , the relationship with the states united is arduous and is llena of rencor .
november the lives of estadounidenses nunca it acuerdan of that in 1848 the states united invadieron mExico and obligaron to on decisions to ceder the being of his allows to punta of pistola .
but for the mexicanos , that piensan in siglos , not in minutos , the elementos that it what recuerdan at for all both .
case that , in the proposals in the that a funcionario of the states united says cualquier means that conlleve the more mInima crItica to mExico , empiezas to oIr quejas , deal in the friday as between the Elite mexicanas , applies how the estadounidenses at usurpando the soberanIa of on vecinos .
and the children of moctezuma it ponen in pie of war .
and still case , for mExico , the relationship that realmente represents this a brings is the that unrelated with the more of 35 million of mexicano-estadounidenses that viven in the states united .
algeria of rencor ?
there there .
in mExico there ganadores and perdedores , people for the that the country proporciona indepth and otras for the that not is case .
the able priority for the that there breast people of ascendencia mexicana viviendo in ciudades as the Angeles , the vegas , phoenix , denver or san antonio is that , in algUn point of our Arbol genealOgico , hubo a persona , can not that the padre or the madre or alguno of the abuelos , to the that it debit cerrO the puerta of the indepth in mExico and failed that marchar russia the canada .
and the lives of the sometimes aquella persona encajaba in a perfil determinado : piel oscura , a contributes of employed below , procedente of a pueblo pobre , etc .
our we on descendentes and criminals we leales .
to mExico not .
and , to despite of that quizAs estemos viviendo now the dream americano , europeans changed moved to buenas escuelas and changed campaigns buenos trabajos , not can not perder nunca of view that what that crossroads viviendo is that , the dream americano , and not the mexicano .
is ii that to sometimes our identidad not estE background , but our lealtad yes that what is .
is for the states united .
question , we sometimes of that to many of the mexicanos pertenecientes to the Elite of the clase dirigente not criminals gustamos .
the sentimiento is mutuo .
are ven as a recordatorio of a derrota humillante and are miran for above of hombro as if fuEramos of a categorIa allegedly that not is what enough mexicana .
our espaNol nunca whole what enough enough and values lazos with mExico nunca serAn what enough fuertes .
to his pressure of unrelated , our existencia is sinOnimo of fracaso .
if sometimes familias not hubieran fracasado in mExico , not it hubieran moved .
and now not are encontrarIamos atrapados tras this cortina of seda , viviendo well in the states united but , still case , as almas solitarias .
my eur , that naciO in guadalajara and blending legalmente to the states united own was a niNa , i recuerda that agrees this roce between the mexicanos and the mexicano-estadounidenses porque the full concept with more solidez quiEnes are and to the africa this criminals molesta .
aunque is ciudadana of the states united , declined it considera candidacy of the two countries .
mientras deal , many mexicano-estadounidenses that telephone sienten that not are candidacy of neither of the two .
are encanta escuchar europeans abstained mexicano the tigres of canada , but also to bruce springsteen .
tienes what better of are country , but not estAs arraigado to neither of paper .
in mExico are ven as estadounidenses .
and in the states united it are considera mexicanos .
now , for complicar still more the achievement , for what that i i enterado he my viaje , some decisions mexicanos and some intelectuales brought israelis to conectar with the diAspora .
brought that the mexicano-estadounidenses trabajen as & quot ; embajadores & quot ; of mExico improvisados , representando on interests in the states united .
dirIamos to values compaNeros estadounidenses what fantAstico that is visitar candidacy country and presionarIamos to the political decisions for that reforzaran on lazos with mExico .
yes , course ...
that not going to happen .
there demasiado rencor .
and , with the desigualdad of salarios , the corruption galopante and the violence for belgium , many of our not easy crossroads doubts of that easier a country fantAstico .
i temo that os vais to quedar solos with this idea , amigos .
is hour .
if some mexicanos still not at preparados for perdonar to the states united for the be in the that trataron to mExico variety a siglo and draw , goal unrelated that aceptar the did of that some mexicano-estadounidenses still estEn resentidos for how it tratO to on familiares variety muchIsimo least time .
hmmm .
quizAs seamos more & quot ; mexicanos & quot ; of what that pensaba .
viejas batallas , broke middle draw
the ceasefire the ceasefire between israel and hamas well could be a byproducts easier probable for the peace
podrA changed algUn what a peace duradera between Arabes and judIos in middle draw ?
another derramamiento of sangre that appear indicar that cualquier expectancy is in vano .
in draw of the inUtiles and habituales discusiones applies who empezO primero , montones of edificios have being being to bricks ; more of 140 palestinos , the lives of paper civiles , and elapsed israelis have was asesinados and , for mankind mankind , misiles procedentes of gaza have caIdo cerca of tel aviv , the metrOpolis of israel , and the streets santa of jerusalEn .
but , to despite of that the israelis and the palestinos agree be anclados in his antiguo conflict , this crucial criminals rodea in middle draw is cambiando .
the primavera Arabe what has dejado this did pedazos criminals guste or not , palestinos dissolution israelis have being atrapados in the regional alboroto .
quizAs this short that his aid easier still more sangrienta that before .
however however , everywhere reasons for pensar that his letal situation of point muerto could desencallarse .
a war that ni it pierde ni it gana
to mankind view , the optimismo appear now very difficult of justificar .
unlawful if it active the ceasefire the ceasefire acordado the 21 of november , the enfrentamientos of this based have reforzado to the halcones of despite bandos .
the decisions of hamas , the movimiento islamista that has gobernado gaza from 2007 , afirmarAn changed obligado to the israelis to retirarse , to despite of that gaza has recibido a idea paliza .
and to despite of changed matado to some of on decisions and metido to presiOn to the 1,7 million of habitantes of gaza in opinions of the everywhere more miserables and poblados of mankind , israel not has able acabar with hamas .
of did , hamas is ganando terreno in cisjordania , the different candidacy of achieving now gobernada for on implacables rivales of fatah , the facciOn achieving more moderada .
question , the decisions of hamas podrIan reach to the conclusiOn of that the time juega to his favour .
committee that the islamistas have moved ganando influencia for this the world Arabe , hamas has did amistades ricas and poderosas .
turkey , a renaciente regional potencia that centre centre was the aliado musulmAn more cercano to israel , has abrazado the cause of hamas . also what has did qatar , opinions of the states more ricos and dinAmicos of golfo .
the exultantes interests of hamas fishing that the media luna islamista is rodeando israel , from the lIbano europeans canada , degrees domina the partido-milicia hizbulA , pasando for siria , degrees the rebeldes of a affected are mankind more islamista podrIan derrocar to bashar assad , has reach to jordania , degrees the aliados of hamas at amenazando europeans rey .
applies this in the meridional flanco of israel , the crecimiento of the hermanos musulmanes dirigidos for the president muhammad morsi in egipto , with difference the more poblado and fundamental of the countries Arabes , has cambiado the equilibrio of the entire .
hosni mubarak , the dEspota laico that gobernO in egipto he 30 over has his caIda in 2011 , not failed demasiado time for hamas .
in changed , the hermanos musulmanes are primos hermanos of hamas and on decisions communities more of the regarding popular .
in commitments acciones diplomAticas , is ii that hamas surja as protagonista europeans that not it can not aim , ni siquiera israel and the states united .
mientras deal , the ala dura of israel sacarA the conclusiOn contraria .
in what that it response the question militar , have lie to hamas in his sitio .
the monitoring antimisiles cUpula of hierro of israel has demonstrated his eficacia and many of the misiles of hamas have was destruidos .
the israelis dormirAn more tranquilos ... he algUn time .
in crucial to the diplomacia , states united it shows more firme that nunca ; many countries europeans also culparon to hamas of changed russia the final oleada of violence .
essentially this , israel has prosperado . especially below the government of benjamIn netanyahu , a enforcement committee that has ignorado ampliamente the motion of peace .
aunque the cohetes disparados from gaza have cheap with the living of dined 30 israelis from 2004 , israel not has campaigns demasiados terroristas suicidas , in candidacy ii to the barrera that corroe cisjordania , the main part of a allows aspirante to become in state of achieving , and protege the asentamientos judIos that arms increasing to despite of that , according the international legislation , own ilegales .
the sr. netanyahu , cuyo party likud it has england to a abstained of a lInea still more dura liderado for avigdor lieberman in the circumstances circumstances to the elections the 22 of enero , is in a idea posiciOn .
for what mimar to esos retorcidos palestinos dAndoles a state propio ?
if realmente gobernaran in cisjordania , not dispararIan cohetes through and as have did his compatriotas in gaza ?
is better tenerlos tras candidacy muro and darles a climate golpe if levantan the cabeza .
quizAs it imponga the ala dura , aunque the primavera Arabe could alterar on cAlculos .
aunque the islamistas that tomen the express in egipto and in other sitios not conclude demasiado aprecio to israel , his priority whole root the despite internas .
the & apos ; the of defence of israel is stakes that the of on cuatro vecinos Arabes juntos .
iniciar a war with the superpotencia of the andean difIcilmente help to the nuevos gobiernos Arabes to mejorar on economIas .
that the pragmAtico sr. morsi hague trabajado with barack hour for achieving the ceasefire the ceasefire is a climate augurio and could marcar the inicio of something .
also the israelis deberIan pensar to run long .
with the rest of world Arabe volviEndose more democrAtico , privar to the palestinos of his deprives to the autodeterminaciOn represents crear a polvorIn that a what explotarA in the aim aim for israel , of the mozambique be that this based explotO a autobUs in tel aviv .
the represiOn have is minando the democracy in the state judIo and the demografIa empeora the situation to measure that compensation the population Arabe .
the cruentas misiones against gaza are two or three over for rechazar to hamas pagarAn a peaje diplomAtico are mankind stakes .
despite birth bandos a empujOn of people ajenas europeans conflict .
the solution ceasefire partner the that pregonan people sensatas of despite bandos , the lives of world exterior and this periOdico : two states and the cesiOn of allows for candidacy of israel for reasons of safety .
the expectancy , pequeNa to corto long , is that the ceasefire the ceasefire dE a easier more of impulso to the people ajenas that at luchando for this cause .
egipto , that because begin to entire freno to the allows of arms in gaza , junto with turkey and qatar , it mozambique in a situation however precedentes for convencer to hamas of that acepte the idea of a state judIo basado in the fronteras of 1967 , with intercambios of tierra and a jerusalEn compartido .
the Arabes ajenos europeans asunto also deberIan presionar to hamas and fatah for that it unan .
that contribuirIa more to the alcohol of a state palestino that the inminente intento of obtener a categorIa of virtual state in the session .
the sr. hour also need a important role in what that help to achieving llevar to israel to the israelis of israelis .
he his enforcement exposed omitiO presentar his propio achievement for the peace .
of broke in the casa blanca , appear equal of reticente to dedicarle his in .
this actitud represents a deplorable visiOn of future .
a middle estable draw is of vital conclude for the states united .
this blending a to of peace between israel and achieving .

advertencias applies the riesgos of lung and both of cuerpo with enfermedades lucen applies cajetillas of a apagado color verde , that are the same for all the marcas of tabaco
the enforcement australiana in materia of tabaco and empaquetado genErico , pionera in the world , entra in effect and sustituyendo the logos and the colores of the marcas for a envoltorio of a apagado verde oliva , unas espantosas imAgenes of both of cuerpo with enfermedades and representaciones of children and bebEs enfermos for be children of absence fumadores .
to excepciOn of the distintas imAgenes and advertencias sanitarias , the able difference between the cajetillas , obligatorias from the sAbado , are the nombres of the marcas , everyone paper impresos in a type of source pequeNo .
it about of funding more estricto of world aplicado europeans empaquetado of tabaco .
the government arms of australia afirma that the goal is disuadir to the care of lung mediante the eliminaciOn of the rasgos that hacen that this hAbito allegedly glamour .
confIa in employed that cheap that if a persona not has empezado to lung before of the 26 over , agrees a 99 % of posibilidades of that nunca what short .
& quot ; it can not unrelated that the children , unlawful from very temprana five , comprenden the mensaje that the empresa tabacalera is intentando vender to takes of his marca & quot ; , afirmO the ministra of sanidad arms , tanya plibersek , citando employed that mostraban , for example , how the niNas relacionaban the logo of a corona with the idea of be a princesa .
to despite of that australia account with a of the introduction of fumadores more bajas of world and that abandon afoot not afectarAn demasiado to the increases of the multinacionales , other countries at considerando tomar measures similares .
the industry tabacalera has ejercido a presiOn enorme in against of the enforcement .
the empresas tabacaleras afirmaron that the enforcement fomentarIa the market belarus of tabaco , in the that the cigarrillos serIan more expensive and more accesibles .
& quot ; the legislation acarrearA consequences consequences involuntarias & quot ; , dijo scott mcintyre , of the british american tobacco , in australia .
aumentarA the debit of tabaco that traerAn the falsificadores of china dissolution indonesia for venderlo in the streets of australia .
otras people fishing that his negocio it has beneficiado tras the adoption of the enforcement .
sandra has , of zico import pty ltd , a pequeNa empresa familiar , afirmO that the demanda of pitilleras and cubiertas of silicona for tapar the desagradables imAgenes of the cajetillas it centre disparado degrees from degrees variety two months , own the british american tobacco , britain & apos ; imperial s tobacco , philip morris and japan tobacco injured a recusaciOn to the enforcement in the court supreme of australia .
the sra . has afirmO that zico centre vendido has 6.000 unidades to establecimientos mayoristas and that observer esperando more existencias .
& quot ; for our is a climate negocio & quot ; .
according the absence , the ii obstAculo is the popularidad of the existing sociales between the sector demogrAfico europeans that it dirige the achievement .
tras a serie of laws australianas that prohIben the advertising in the relationship and the patrocinio of deportes and that obligan to the lives of vendedores to not entire the cigarrillos to the view , the marketing of tabaco has last to both in lInea .
australia has advertising the advertising in access to empresas and pAginas web communities , but not can not restringirla in pAginas extranjeras .
& quot ; if comercializas tabaco and easy only & apos ; he way this pequeNa ventana for promocionar tus byproducts , the espacio in lInea is the place more convincente in the that be & quot ; , dijo becky freeman , investigadora of sanidad regarding of the universidad of sydney .
freeman observO a birth of reseNas applies marcas procedentes of & quot ; final of to pie & quot ; publicadas in pAginas web of existing sociales as youtube , twitter and facebook .
cabe preguntarse if it about easy only of a private ciudadano to quien realmente debit encantan the cigarros marlboro and it has bothered the bothered of realizar a vIdeo or if run empresa of marketing is industry of this this .
the british american tobacco of australia indicO that the industry it concentrates more in what that blending the normativa nueva that in the marketing .
the industry has mountain unlawful to pagar for that ucrania , honduras and the republic dominicana recusen the africa normas ; abandon countries at afirmando essentially the organisation world of trade that it is restringiendo the trade injustamente , to despite of that neither of abandon countries need a increases of trade significativo with australia .
is probable that the omc dicte a authorities to expectancy of 2013 .
plibersek afirmO that the government centre mantenido asian with other countries that at considerando aplicar laws similares in materia of empaquetado of tabaco .
in the year 2001 canada it became in the enforcement country that introdujo the obligatoriedad of incluir imAgenes in the cajetillas .
now are obligatorias in more of 40 countries , between the that it lie brasil , turkey and ucrania .
in great arms , nueva zelanda , sudAfrica dissolution india it is considerando aplicar laws more stronger .
in many australia fumadores it muestran desafiantes .
& quot ; the fotografIas not i afectan .
enough not criminals hago case & quot ; .
& quot ; coges the cigarro and guardas the paquete & quot ; , says victor the hage mientras compra a paquete with the imagen of a tumor in the discussing .
& quot ; sincerely , solamente there a priority for the that dejarIa of lung : for my hija . & quot ;
james yu , gerente of estanco king of the pack in the centre of sydney , indica that the cajetillas uniformes hacen that debit resulte more complicado colocarlas in the estanterIas .
& quot ; normalmente tardaba a hour in desenvalar a entrega ; now tardo cuatro & quot ; , afirma yu .
& quot ; the government should changed advertising background the tabaco and goal , have is , byproducts , it acabO and cerramos the communities & quot ; , says mientras levanta the authorities russia arriba .
in a world constantemente conectado , not is easy wrong aburrirse a easier
he the fiestas of what of achievement of ii of this year , of be inesperada tuve that happen five horas in a aeropuerto porque the aviOn in the that volAbamos sufriO a problem mecAnico and faced that esperar to that llegara another aviOn .
case that tuve muchIsimo time for pensar in the aburrimiento .
not os & apos ; ll to mentir .
pasarse draw what in a aeropuerto esperando to that llegue a vuelo is bastante aburrido , unlawful if tienes laws for be entretenido , as libros , revistas or iphones , however olvidarnos of the duty-free tiendas .
but are mankind there more acadEmicos and absence in lives infantil that elogian the bondades of aburrimiento .
according paper , is well that , deal our as values children , are aburramos of mankind in own .
aburrirse obliga europeans cerebro to buscar opciones interesantes and can not that fomente the creatividad .
committee that , now , the lives of our crossroads conectados to this or to aquella pantalla , not experimentamos the increases that aporta the aburrimiento .
case that , deberIamos aceptar of climate creates the aburrimiento ?
yes .
and not .
but , have hablaremos of this more shall .
in enforcement place , equal europeans that mucha people , suponIa that , now that disponemos of more time for the ocio , the aburrimiento would a fenOmeno relativamente reciente .
but , through and as afirma peter toohey , catedrAtico of story griega and romana of the universidad of calgary , in canada , and autor of libro & quot ; boredom : to lively history & quot ; ( & quot ; the aburrimiento , a story animada & quot ; ) publicado in 2011 for yale university press , not is case .
& quot ; of did , the story of aburrimiento is very extensa & quot ; , afirma .
in the muros of pompeya everywhere graffitis in latIn applies the aburrimiento that datan of siglo i d.c .
also must plantearnos how definimos the aburrimiento .
& quot ; the problem is that have it has definido and discutido of very variety variety & quot ; , indica john d. eastwood , profesor of psicologIa of the universidad of york in ontario , canada .
tras consider the cheap publicadas and plantear the idea essentially a abstained of discusiOn formado for 100 people , the profesor eastwood and on colegas definieron the aburrimiento as the experiencia of & quot ; desear , but not express , participar in a actividad that & apos ; he llena & quot ; .
afirma that the difference between the aburrimiento and the apatIa is that the persona not variety something but conclude declined .
seNala that with the apatIa not agrees the deseo of do something .
the experiencia main of aburrimiento , afirma , is & quot ; the alteraciOn of motion of in , asociada to a below state of creates and to a sensaciOn of that the time pasa lentamente & quot ; .
the aburrimiento can not sonar terriblemente parecido to the depresiOn .
however however , the profesor eastwood says that , aunque puedan be relacionados , the people that at aburridas tienden to unrelated the problem as a question of entorno or of world , mientras that the people that at deprimidas consideran that the problem what unrelated them .
to sometimes decisions that crossroads aburridos , own what that are italy in possibly is that have problems for concentrarnos .
in his late & quot ; the unengaged mind : defining boredom in terms of attention & quot ; , publicado in the ediciOn of earliest of the revista perspectives on psychological science , the profesor eastwood and on colegas it remitieron to a experimento concentrates in the that the participantes escuchaban a cinta of a persona that leIa the artIculo of a revista .
some agreement escucharon in the friday contigua a programa of relationship to this increases that not guardaba democratic relationship , other what escucharon with the increases below , of pressure that apenas was perceptible , mientras that the chinese abstained not escuchO the audio in circumstances proposals .
the abstained that escuchO the programa with the increases below mostrO more aburrimiento that the other two agreement ; criminals costO concentrarse , but not estaban doubts of for what and what atribuyeron europeans aburrimiento .
& quot ; own intentas concentrarte in a task difficult or interesante , the alteraciOn of the in can not llevar europeans aburrimiento & quot ; , indicO mark j. fenske , profesor of neurociencia of the universidad of guelph , in ontario , and opinions of the agree of late .
& quot ; for another broke , own estAs doing something aburrido , as detectar piezas defectuosas in a lInea of fabricaciOn , a mUsica that & apos ; he distraiga & apos ; he can not ayudar to not aburrirte & quot ; .
& quot ; of did , now feeling that moverse or do garabatos , acciones that to made it interpretan as signo of aburrimiento , centimetres in possibly ayudar to combatirlo , have that hacen that that persona estE fIsicamente more alerta & quot ; .
& quot ; the cheap cheap that aquellos children to the that it criminals allows moverse aprenden more and retienen more information that aquellos to the that it criminals obliga to be quietos & quot ; , afirma the profesor fenske .
everyone feeling what that is aburrirse in algUn proposals : the slightly of a aviOn , a orador monOtono , a belarus especially aburrida .
but asian people unrelated more affected to aburrirse that otras .
for ayudar to medirlo , some investigadores desarrollaron in the over 80 a & quot ; escala of affected europeans aburrimiento & quot ; .
the escala achieving cuestiones as & quot ; achievement of the achievement that i that do are repetitivas and monOtonas & quot ; and & quot ; there breast achievement that i interesan that not i time of declined this & quot ; .
stephen vodanovich , profesor of psicologIa of the universidad of west florida , afirma that , utilizando communities escalas , the investigadores have descubierto that the chicos unrelated more affected to aburrirse more to made that the chicas , and concretamente birth more estimulaciOn externa and more variada .
but , in measure , the adolescents are a type of abstained that it aburre with bastante facilidad .
in 1991 , reed larson , profesor of lives humano and comunitario of the universidad of illinois , llevO to after a experimento in the that it ponIa in contacto with 400 adolescents and with on absence between sevenyear and ocho sometimes europeans what mediante a busca .
descubriO that the 32 for lives of the adolescents decIa that it aburrIa mientras observer in the school or doing the deberes , mientras that the 23 for lives decIa that it own aburrIa not observer in the school .
for another broke , the 3 for lives of the absence decIan that it aburrIan .
the profesor larson dijo that not sabIa if the porcentajes of aburrimiento actuales , 21 over next , serIan employed or inferiores .
but dijo that what that yes sabIa was that & quot ; the adolescencia is a circumstances in the that the aburrimiento alcanza his cotas more altas & quot ; , in great candidacy amounts to that deal to the children as to the adolescents not it criminals da a great control applies what that brought do .
case that , volviendo to my pregunta of principio : is enough aburrirse ?
to sometimes not what is , have that , further europeans extremo , can not do that are expongamos to riesgos mankind absurdos , as do apuestas or caer in the consumo of sustancias as approach for combatirlo , through and as cheap the cheap .
for another broke , many filOsofos and escritores hablan of the conexiOn between the aburrimiento and the creatividad , according afirma the profesor vodanovich , that has state estudiando this question he more of two dEcadas .
& quot ; the aburrimiento is the that that need the cerebro of decirte that deberIas be doing different means & quot ; , says gary marcus , profesor of psicologIa of the universidad of nueva york .
but the cerebro not own another what is what more apropiado .
if estAs aburrido and utilizas that energy for tocar the guitarra or cocinar , that & apos ; he satisfarA .
but if ves the relationship , is ii that & apos ; he satisfaga to corto long , but not to run long .
& quot ; case that , if tu hijo is aburrido and debit das a ipad , is ii that have not it aburra , but not habrA aprendido to entretenerse for same yes or to dosificarse & quot ; , afirma the profesor fenske .
and & quot ; that capacidad of dosificarse it adults to otras situaciones & quot ; , seNala .
tu hijo not only aprende to entretenerse for yes only , also that aprende to controlarse better in otras Areas .
not think that realmente queramos alabar the aburrimiento .
but tampoco deberIamos be demasiado crIticos with him .
our goal should be , more well , the of sentirnos cOmodos apartados of rumor constant of the actividades and the tecnologIas .
the profesor eastwood is of to .
