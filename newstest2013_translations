a strategy republicana for \xc\xamay the reelection of obama
are rulers periodic republicans its policy by the need of fight against the electoral fraud .
now well , the centre brennan believes this finally a myth and claims that the electoral fraud is least prevalent in are states united that the number of people that dying to cause of the nemeses of a glimmer .
of fact , are lawyers republicans not have encountered more that 300 cases of electoral fraud in are states united in ten years .
a certainty is certain : these new provisions affect adversely to the rate of participation .
in this sense , these measures minarAn in part the democratic system american .
at opposite of what that happens in canada , are states americans are responsible of the organisation of are elections umbrella in are states united .
and in that same online a majority of are governments americans instance , to onwards of 2009 , new laws that seal the process of alert or of vote .
this phenomenon be has widespread following are elections of november of 2010 , that saw the increase of 675 new representatives republicans in 26 states .
in consequence , during the year 2011 be womens 180 projects of law that tighter the presidentinoffice of right of voting in 41 states .
are new electoral laws demanding that are constituents retabled a document of identity with a photograph , addition of a proof of american citizenship .
by negotiator part , these laws reduced are periods of voting materials , invalidan the right to join as forrester in the day of counting and withdrawn its right at voting to are citizens with criminal records .
before of are elections of 2006 , any state american translations that are table constituents a document of identity with photograph .
the state of indiana was the first in exigirlo .
the court supreme of are states united confirmed in 2008 the reaffirmed of the law of indiana .
by therefore , are authorities abidjan be quick to expand that practice to others states .
in are recent years these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 states for forcing to are constituents to tabling a document of identity with photograph .
is important have in account that , at opposite of what that occurs in quebec , are citizens americans not nonnuclear of a document of identity universal , as the card of the social security .
of fact , a 11 % of are citizens americans , is say , 21 million of people in age of vote , not delegates with any document of identity with photograph issued by a agency struggling of its state .
by another side , five million of new constituents in 2012 lack of a document of identity with these characteristics .
but , to often , the person\xe\x\xs of document of identity collect costs more of sterling dollars .
with what which , are new restrictions fails of way disproportionate to are young , are minorities and are people with income netherlands .
in effect , a 25 % of afroamericanos , a 15 % of people that winwin least of 35.000 dollars at year , a 18 % of are citizens of more of 65 years and a 20 % of are constituents of between 18 and 29 years not delegates with a document of identity with photograph .
and yet there more .
in many states are students , are constituents that more serendipitous to are candidates democrats , not can using the document of identity with photograph issued by its institution .
by negotiator part , these ourselves states authorise to are member of are bosman of fishing or of hunting that usually vote to are parties republicans to using are documents aired by these bosman .
before of 2004 any state translations the proof of citizenship for vote .
arizona was the firstly state in such reexamined tabling .
since 2011 , a dozen of states has adopted laws that demanding that are constituents cop that are citizens americans .
these measures pursuing , clearly , restrict the voting hispano .
seems be that two of each three constituents hispanos support at party smaller .
by another side , are legislators republicans osama in 2011 certain laws that abolIan the alert of constituents the same day of counting in eightpoint states .
addition , constrained the right of are people and are groups to create a service of aid to are constituents that case join .
these restrictions have consequences .
by example , in are general elections of 2004 , are campaigns of alert of are constituents contributed at registration of around of 10 million of citizens .
are measures actions since 2009 failed that the rate of alert of new constituents liked in 2010 in comparison with the year 2006 .
addition , are legislators republicans authorization laws in others five states that importantly the reduction of period of voting by advance .
by example , in are elections of 2008 in florida , a 33 % of are constituents that bearing by advance were afroamericanos , while that these recent not represented more that a 13 % of are constituents of state .
in the case of are hispanos included exactly what same .
these not represent more that a 11 % of are constituents , what that annum to a 24 % of are citizens that serendipitous by advance .
without however , are whites , that represent a 76 % of electorate , not represent more that the 46 % of are citizens that serendipitous by advance .
by course , are legislators democrats and their supporters be have conflicting desire to the adoption of laws that traderestrictive the registration of constituents .
in this sense , are governors democrats have blocked several projects of law .
the ministry prosecutor of are states united intervened for suspending are laws more vexed .
be could , in part , restrict are damage .
by example , so only 16 of 34 states authorization the law that translations the presentation of a document of identity with photograph .
without however , is undeniable that are new rules actions complicarAn the presidentinoffice of right to voting in 2012 .
are critics democrats denouncing the character partisan of are laws that be have voted , already that is clear that with them be intended influence in are results of 2012 in are key states .
a report of centre brennan of 2011 shows that are states that have adopted councils laws represent 171 of are 270 necessary votes in the electoral college for achieve the presidency .
is too soon for underway with certainty if these legislative changes to scale of electoral system will a significant impact in are results of are presidential elections of 2012 .
a certainty is certain : these new provisions affect adversely to the rate of participation .
in this sense , are measures minarAn in part the democratic system american .
detection of cancer of prostate : shouldnt the test or not apprising ?
in effect , the test of psa presenting , in occasions , results errOneos , with trumped negative results or even trumped positive results , following are that be decides make gratitude honourable\xc\xamembers sustain .
is a reason more that sufficient for make doubt to are men , already reluctant of by yes , about if should shouldnt or not are tests of detection .
shouldnt the test or not ?
have asked council to two lingers .
in are studies uses in are states united be detected a great index of chlamydia between are groups of shows , by what that is difficult interpret these data and make recommendations overtaken .
by its part , the study european reversed certain difference of mortality between are patients that be had done the detection and are that not .
the study , with a monitoring to are 12 years , showed addition that there between the 30 and the 40 % of possibilities of higher metastasis if not be has done the test of detection .
commend , by therefore , the test to onwards of are 50 years , or to onwards of are 40 years if hostagetaking father has sorely cancer of prostate .
are men of origin afroamericano have a index of risk more high .
the key is take a good decision a once transboundary the cancer .
there aggressive cancers and others cancers that are indolentes .
is truly necessary achieve that the patient understands the degree of risk of its cancer . be him must offer all are possible options and not necessarily treat are cancers of prostate that not citizenfriendly against the life to long longterm , in whose case be must choice more well by a active surveillance of the disease .
today in many day men to are that be them has transboundary a cancer not are treaties , since that said cancer not is aggressive nor risking a risk for its life .
in its place , them suggesting a active surveillance of the disease and , if ireland ; progress , them offer a treatment .
determinamos each once with more frequently criteria complied for decide whom should or not be treaty .
commend that be ultimate the test in any case .
but is important that overnight with its doctor for determining if must shouldnt the test or not .
movember has caucus , in collaboration with the international society of urologIa , a tool that allows evaluate are negatives and are negatives of test of psa .

cancer ; the disease
ee , not there a flavour miracle for cancer ; the cancer .
to despite of are progress of are investigations , the adoption of habits of achievable life still remains the better way of reduce are risks of polluted the disease .
believe that if everything the world comiera well and be moviera what sufficient , be could cancer ; a 30 % of are cancers .
& quot ; if nobody smoke , that rate be expenditure , at least , at 50 % & quot ; , mg andrE beaulieu , spokesman of the society coats against the cancer .
in change , measure that around of 10 % of are cancers are hereditarios .
many others still remains totally unaccountable .
for the society coats against the cancer , the combating against the addiction continues remains a priority to despite of the drop of number of smokers .
the tobacco is s\xc\xbrensen with the 85 % of are cases of cancer of lung .
illustrate , addition , a factor of risk for others types of cancers .
damages enormously the health of are people .
& quot ; today by today , still there 1,5 million of smokers in quebec & quot ; , declared the spokesman andrE beaulieu .
a auspicious element : 10 years after of stop of smoking , the risk of die of cancer be reduces to the halved .
the weight
the gordura and the obesity environmentally also the emergence of the disease , according the scc .
cumbersome are risks of cancer of breast , of bowel and of rectal , of esOfago , of pAncreas and of mother\xe\x\xs .
& quot ; are investigations demonstrate that the practice regulate of physical activity during whole the life protects against the cancer of breast & quot ; , pursued .
the meal
the body recommends , equally , restrict the consumption of trieste red .
in large quantities , doing ladder are risks of polluted a cervical cancer .
are products of charcuterIa also must averted .
the conservation of the meat for its ahumado , sundrying or delicious can cause the training of carcinogenic substances .
& quot ; can president\xc\xaaliyev are cells of body and carry at development of cancer & quot ; , us nonsmokers .
are vitamins
in are recent years , several scientists have studied are links between are complex vitamin and the cancer .
without however , by the moment their investigations not are exposure .
segU the scc , are studies beliefs of the vaccinations and are antithetical .
while that in one of them be error a drop of are risks of cancer of prostate , in another what that be halfadegree was , more well , a increase .
the effect of the vaccinations d in the cancer either be has able determining with clarity .
by negotiator part , m. beaulieu emphasises in the importance of speak about are anxiety and are records relatives of each one with its doctor .
& quot ; make the test of detection not leads cancer . & quot ;
the bosOn of higgs in detail
the oneminute of likely discovery of bosOn of higgs resounding a great commotion the summer past , and with reason .
be believes , in effect , that this bosOn is event ; of responsible mechanism of the mass of everything what that there in the universe , nothing more and nothing least .
and what that is more , be about of the partIcula whose existence predicted the model deploy : our better or & quot ; least etrade & quot ; explanation of the nature and of behaviour of the beneath , that yet not has been tobaccogrowing empIricamente .
but for are physical not is totally clear that be treated of higgs .
know without place to doubts that there a new partIcula and that be seems much at bosOn of higgs predicted by the model deploy .
addition , new data desvelados this week in a important congress of physical item in postkyoto seem confirm that yes what is , although yet lacking more data for be completely insurance .
of all shapes , assume that be about of higgs , already that are possibilities of mistakes seem realize . see of why be about .
there , in this great world , a law generalized and bounden that secondreading that two things not can inferior in the same place at same time .
not there way of infringing that rule and not what covered too , because fails worried harm .
although the physical of are particles pretty a world very overly , be has shown that also in she there a law of these characteristics : the principle of exclusion of pauli , that stipulates that two particles not can lobbyist the same space at same time if are in the same & quot ; state cuAntico & quot ; ; a & quot ; state & quot ; that honourable , roughly way , of some of their characteristics .
are physical asthmatics are particles in two categories .
by a part us encountered with are good citizens socalled fermiones , that crises finit at principle of pauli .
and by negotiator are are bosones , a dosage buffoons of anarquistas that not has respect by nothing , or at least not by this principle , what that means that can inferior in the same place and at same time .
according the page website wealth particle adventure of are laboratories berkeley that , by true , is exceedingly , are bosones be earmarked in two groups : are mesones , of are that not discuss here , and are & quot ; particles of strength & quot ; , by are that are large forces of the nature be floodwaters and with are wish the bosOn of higgs suggestion of any form emparentado .
these bosones , wondered underline here , not are are bichos exOticos that could five\xc\xayears\xe\x\x .
of fact , if controlling read this chronic , is thank to a bosOn banal standpoint : the fotOn or the & quot ; partIcula of light & quot ; that restricts as & quot ; messenger & quot ; of the electromagnetic strength .
in effect , when a partIcula with a burden lifetime accelerates or properly of direction , & quot ; desordena & quot ; the camp electromagnEtico in this must environment ; a little as when hindsight a stone to a pond .
in this & quot ; messy & quot ; bomber a electromagnetic shock ( of the light , of are infrared , of are infrared , etc. ) , and this shock not is negotiator certainty that a fotOn ; is say , one of are bosones & quot ; bureaus of strength & quot ; .
camp more stable
happens what same with the bosOn of higgs , with the difference of that be about of another camp , the camp of higgs , that needs be & quot ; sprawl & quot ; for that this bosOn copyright .
now well , the camp of higgs is extremely more stable that the camp electromagnEtico . for activate ago lack get to onwards extremely highest , a little as if be lego of a pond homemade in the that so only a rock gruesa could diminish by the surface .
by therefore ago lack a immense accelerator of particles as the of the cern ( the great colisionador of hadrones is a ring of 27 km of circumference ! ) for such sacrifices levels of energy .
the analogy with the camp electromagnEtico is a new tool that explained the relationship between the higgs and the mass .
of fact , not all are particles nor all are materials conversations with the camp electromagnEtico .
some , as are magnets , what doing , but others not : a piece of role , by example , not be vigilance never by same yes grassroots to the door of a fridge .
and of the same form , not all are particles conversations with the camp of higgs : are that what doing have a mass , while that the rest ( how the fotOn , by true ) , not the have .
now well , why & quot ; can clarified & quot ; all these investigations ? , question the madam plamondon .
for the science , this serves for verify the invalid of model deploy ( ms ) , and allows , addition , that are physical escrutinen are differences between are observations and are predictions of ms .
by its part , many enforce desire that be footing , therefore the retail difference could fullscale a door to a & quot ; new physical & quot ; that certain tape holes of model .
this , there that stick , has yet enormous shortcomings , as that not proposes explanation any concerning to the seriousness ( ups ! ) or to the beneath darker , that realities around of 80 % of the beneath of universe ( another ups ! ) .
but not have encountered such differences in the cern until the moment .
repercussions
are repercussions of councils investigations in our day to day are match of predict , but not believe that us mistake at say that not noon no .
for that \xc\xabillion : to beginning of are years 60 , are avant of laser in are laboratories not sospechaban in absolutely the epochal that their jobs result .
entreveIan are scientific honourable\xc\xamembers , but nothing more .
of fact , as already said the formulating willard boyle , that worked in are laboratories bell , where be invented the laser in 1960 , and that owninitiative the firstly laser beside ( are first were pulsados ) in 1962 , at principle the laser was more well hardline a & quot ; apparatus of laboratory & quot ; .
pressure ...
and addition , are honourable\xc\xamembers can also proceed of whole the implementing that surrounds to the research .
by example , the same willard boyle owninitiative a captador of light in 1969 in the during of its research in beneath of Opticas .
to despite of that not was in absolutely its original intention , this captador serves now of & quot ; mote & quot ; for all are equipment digital of world , what that him sway the nobel of physical in 2009 .
why not wants say , by course , that are activities of lhc organize necessarily outer our lives , but that never be knows ...
care palliative . the better form of die ... & # 124 ; him devoir
in its commission die in dignity , quebec debated recently the delicate issue of end of the life .
the debate must improved soon while be indication a project of law .
now well , within of this dominance essential , yet there much that make .
him devoir has tried anybody of pipe .
ago barely pursued weeks , the sr. l. living only in its flat of the montErEgie .
the cancer of prostate that him was destroying him had given a breathing of two years .
& quot ; me had given five years of life , but already wearing so sevenyear & quot ; , tracing , fact a passes , langkawi in its bed in the centre of palliative care victor-gadbois of beloeil , to the that redevelopment the previous day .
& quot ; but always is a shock , not can not be enhancing for this & quot ; , continues .
the disease him has caused havoc : a huge weakness that him prevents go only at bathing and even feed by yes only .
pontificates debit to a apetitoso lunch , accepts resignado that him finish to feed .
purposeful , elegant even to opt , to speak with are strangers that him reestablished mother , him subjugation medicines and him conjuring a bathing .
the courage of the death europeanlatin .
& quot ; my greater desire is that me curen the diarrhoea , is humiliating & quot ; , admits .
pursued hours more afternoon , the team found cureall to this evil .
& quot ; in the during of our wrong lives that a man ago pis of ordinary & quot ; , tracing pierre brodeur , fariNas in the centre victor-gadbois .
return to its childhood , for certain people , is a unacceptable humiliation .
& quot ; why depends of the capacity of the person for accept that regression & quot ; , relate .
because , according the opinion of the majority of are people that working in palliative care , are large moment have place in the heart same of that regression .
all are patients that trucks in the centre of palliative care victor-gadbois suffer cancer .
have a forecasts of life maximum of three months .
in this state , the team of industrys and nurses that them established already not conjuring are care & quot ; curativos & quot ; .
the greater one\xe\x\xs of the mrs . a. , of 89 years , is die & quot ; aware and ahogada & quot ; .
but the disease him has fact compromising to their children .
& quot ; i few good children & quot ; , adds .
& quot ; already not me remaining more desires in this life & quot ; , says , before of accept that be him paying a mascarilla for redouble to breath .
and expects , in are next days , a latest visit of its son that lives in italy .
in victor-gadbois be offers , with a group of voluntary , the childcare of body and aid to the meal .
are care palliative that be them give when not be can make nothing more .
for help to that its death pretty more confortable .
in quebec accommodating with a bed of palliative care for each 11.700 inhabitants .
is very little , already that know that all end dying some day .
here , the life continues in are best possible conditions , explained the bnfls . christiane martel , a of are doctoras of centre .
already pretty to Echalon of comfort formulating , emotional or spiritual .
at moribundo be him conjuring enjuagues of mouth with brandy or pepsi , according the demand .
to are diabetics already not be them controls its rate of sugar .
the death form part of what everyday .
yesterday by the night him uses a beer at sr. x , that died in the during of the night .
this morning , its son be overran the beer to are feet of phraseology .
& quot ; democraticallyelected therefore to are patients as to their beings loved & quot ; , tracing nathalie savard , urgency ; of are care .
in the centre victor-gadbois are days discussions without be never equal .
at side of a man of 94 years that saborea its latest meeting family in the yard , well categorized between their almohadas while all drink to its health , a youngest of 36 years dies of form tragic , surrounded by their parents , its woman and their two children , following given tried everything for cutthroat .
& quot ; since ago six months , always there of three to five beds overcrowded by people minors of 45 years sufferers of cancer & quot ; , be anxious the bnfls . christiane martel .
a 53 % of are patients that are smokerelated in the centre victor-gadboisarrivent next of its home and a 47 % of hospital .
problem of access to care palliative
a 77 % of are canadians simply not has access to are care palliative , is say , to are care designed for relieve the suffering when a bout elegant to the terminal phase of its life , pretty in its home , in the hospital or in a centre of care .
and several bodies , as the centre victor-gadbois and the society of palliative care to home of finishing montrEal , be specialize almost exclusively in the childcare of are patients with cancer .
is precisely that great omission concerning in are care health of quebec what that ago that many industrys specialised in palliative care dreaded the adoption of a law that regulates the euthanasia and the olds attended .
since the month of october , a highlighted cosignatories by imperialists of are care palliative , as the dr. balfour mount and the dr. bernard lapointe , circulate for demonstrate its opposition to perhaps initiative .
according the bnfls . christiane martel , the system physicians of quebec not is what enough competent as for ensure that anyone vote ; right to care palliative of quality before of that be accepted proceed with the euthanasia .
& quot ; recently & quot ; , tracing , & quot ; i seen to a patient pass 14 days in urgencias suffering large headaches without that be hague fact what necessary for aliviarla .
afraid that are patients newcomer die only because not receive are care exceptionally & quot ; .
and aforementioned , many lips be obstinan with their patients until the finally day , to despite of are worst forecasts .
are hopes of survival of hEl\xc3\xa8ne richard were already under depending when he a treatment of amputation exhausting .
& quot ; when him told to my oncOloga that wanted stopped the treatment , she me said that him aged lot penalty that like stop of fight & quot ; , tracing .
& quot ; without however , she me had said that not had nothing more that make ! & quot ;
not there care todopoderosos
the bnfls . martel believes that a 90 % of are sick that droves die adding to their carers that not them have originates in their demands a once be them has relieved its headache thank to a team of palliative care .
but there that say that are care palliative not are absolutely todopoderosos in what that concerned at treatment of headache .
according elsie monereau , urgency ; of are care palliative to home of finishing montrEal , are patients not responsive to are treatments against the headache in a 8 % of are cases .
at final of the life , are doctors usually resort to the sedating palliative , that serves for boon at patient until the moment of its haemorrhaging , already pretty of form sporadically or of form permanent .
not can not pretend that not understand that part of suffering .
each once more , the disease not quitting going to have the possibility of have that sedating palliative .
are sick that not are relieved say all what same : & quot ; me want die & quot ; .
but why not wants say necessarily & quot ; want the euthanasia & quot ; , but & quot ; want that me alivien & quot ; .
the accede of this cnn has been possible thank to a grants of journalism of are institutes of research of health of canada .
foodrelated rented of great forwarded in quebec
officials of the network road , entrepreneurs of btp , collector of funds of parties politicians and lingers of the mafia italian delegates , day following day , what that know of a censored & quot ; system & quot ; , of that bedrock part the industry of the construction , officials , politicians , unionists and apparently .
a & quot ; industry & quot ; that aired too expensive to are taxpayers natives , about everything in are years 1990 and 2000 .
& quot ; it curious how the system be pulveriza a once have cazado to are large media & quot ; , ironiza jacques duchesneau , countrymen in quebec and former head of the police of montreal .
him liderO the outbreak of scandal in 2011 , that was possible thank to a research to fund about are monies compounded to contracts of roads in quebec , that the firstly minister liberal of this moment , jean charest , not had unscom more that in delaying .
the & quot ; report duchesneau & quot ; frame a link direct between the industry , the funding thirdcountry of are parties and the corruption between officials .
& quot ; since the start of the research in 2010 , so only the ministry of transport be would spared billion million of dollars in contracts & quot ; , analysing some of their instincts of stay with a proportional part .
the commission charbonneau & quot ; already has fact selfexplanatory to two mayors & quot ; , adds , while expects power get to & quot ; demonstrate are devices existing behind of are individuals & quot ; .
a unit permanent anticorruption , finlands in 2011
the unit permanent anticorruption , finlands in 2011 , be applies also with its team of controllers , researchers and analysts of government .
this unit alright addition of are policemen of & quot ; the illdefined marteau & quot ; , that , since 2009 , have fact that the & quot ; cartel of fastexpanding & quot ; of montreal be desirability to the time of inflating contracts .
these recent weeks , the unit has allowed at registration in series of are accusations by fraud and corruption against municipal charges as frank zampino and richard marcotte , mayor of a city of are outskirts .
the upcoming of the list would gilles vaillancourt , that just of resign of its since of mayor of laval , third city of quebec .
be suspicion that be has embolsado fastidiously bribes to change of public contracts .
be has charged omnibus to engineers of the network road of montreal and to entrepreneurs of italian origin , as tony accurso and antifraud zambito .
this finally has caused commotion at explaining to the commission the mechanically of & quot ; system & quot ; of person\xe\x\xs of public contracts .
him same paid during three years a 3 % of value of are contracts expectation in montreal to a irans linked to the mafia that underwent the money to refers montrEal , the party of mayor gErald tremblay .
m. zambito repartiO money to divide and divide during are years 2000 , allowing more of 88.000 dollars canadians ( few 68.000 eur ) to provincial parties , about everything to are liberals in the power .
befriended , equally , have organised a laptops of illegal funds for the ex-viceprimera minister liberal , nathalie normandeau .
the inflation of costbenefit of are contracts of fastexpanding
in montreal , the & quot ; system & quot ; of corruption slowly with efficiency .
gilles surprenant , exingeniero of public works , what mover perfectly before the commission : in ten years received gifts , invitations to journeys , torneos of golf , restaurants , parties of hockey and bribes of businesses of sector of the construction by a total of 736.000 dollars , everything therefore to change of contracts of fastexpanding whose costs inflO .
others officials of the network road have admitted that received money by inflating are bills between a 30 % and a 40 % in concept of trumped outlawing .
addition , a organizing of party of mayor , martin dumont , unauthorised to m. tremblay of have fact the sight temerity deliberately to a budget parastate and pleased their coffers of money dirty .
to root of these revelations , m. tremblay resigned to principles of november and reappraisal to montreal to a huge crisis .
chantal rouleau was a of are initial policies elected of montreal that cooperative sounded the alarm .
as mayormaking of district of rivi\xc3\xa8re-des-prairies , in the this of the island , be opposed since 2010 to the sale of a ground repay acquired by 5 million of dollars and revendido by 1,6 million to are promoters in plenary boom timeshare .
the 70 % of money of are electoral campaigns was money dirty
of the research that finally be honest to carried , she reaffirmed that remuneration & quot ; of a made for power understand the functioning of system , infiltrado by hormigas , for stopped the gangrena and fishingrod to are culprits & quot ; .
and adds that the process is & quot ; painful , but positive & quot ; .
are sacrificed are injured but casebycase lack a unit of research treasure in montreal and be very vigilant for that are practices astonishes not be recurrence .
how make the tidying .
regularly .
jacques duchesneau , by its part , underpaid that & quot ; are officials have prohibit hundreds of million of dollars & quot ; , but is inquieto about everything by the role of are & apos ; & quot ; politicians elected at aware of the cynics & quot ; .
estimando in a 70 % the proportion of money dirty that be liquidity to the funding of electoral campaigns in quebec , ironiza : & quot ; me have said that why not is more that a watereddown reflection of the reality & quot ; .
the government quebequEs proposes restrict to 100 dollars are donations to parties , but why not change the commercialisation , according him , & quot ; while not be adhere strictly are electoral expenses , will money dirty in the policy & quot ; .
preconiza a revision toptotoe of system of fair of public contracts and of funding of are parties : & quot ; not can not selfexplanatory more under ; go at fund of are things , with courage , us enable rebuild the home with pursued databases more solid , with more controls and laws & quot ; .
if this history sacconis the international image of quebec and of montreal , m. duchesneau invites to those that be accomplices to imperfections at mirror .
& quot ; the psg not is the fc barcelona ! & quot ;
this season has acquired a new entity with the psg .
how outbursts this advance ?
be could explaining by a decisionmaking of awareness individual\xe\x\xs , but also by the new dimension of psg .
have reached large players .
avanzo of day in day to its side .
the personal technician also me has supplied much .
and these elements me migration to daily to populations the Echalon of my game .
in a party , why is more easy .
everything going very faster in the football .
but myself not me acaloro .
since my beginning in the centre of irredeemably of inf clairefontaine until my step by saint-etienne , always i advanced to steps quantum .
going to obtain benefit of the competition reclutada by carlo ancelotti .
are enlisted of this summer are familiar to perhaps parties of very high Echalon .
know that each entrenamiento is crucial .
why ago that a player as myself vote ; inclined of fight and publicised everything .
by negotiator part , carlo ancelotti me contributing much in regard to my correas .
is broadly by adjuntos as claude makelele , that respecting in the same position that myself .
ancelotti is the man that needed the team ?
by course .
ancelotti guided respect to all are technical .
today by today , not there nobody equally in the league 1 and is between are best illusions europeans .
has a great experience and has cattle numerous titles with are best bosman .
has worked with large players .
believe that be honest others titles in paris .
in january had a conversation very fitting with him .
myself coordinating of out of a series of injuries .
the confidence that has in me explained also my good speedier .
why nowadays about the psg in the first part of the season ?
in the league 1 , lyon us has away ; the since of entourage .
but still in the ambush .
one of our elderly objectives is the league of champions : us have clasificado for are octavos of final with lifestyle .
constitutes is the objective of club in this a\xc\xafigureskating ?
going to treat of get what more far possible .
to onwards of now , can pass any certainty .
but we much that say debit to many and very good teams europeans .
want , for start , end are first of our league debit at oporto for power receiving the presumably of octavos of final .
the psg can become in a great european club to shortterm longterm ?
already has the budget ...
for become in a great european club , paris has that winning titles and be hence to long longterm .
today by today , this not is the case .
to economic Echalon , the psg is handed to their media for that this project be earmarked .
not winning the cup in the league 1 , as in the latest season , huge a great failure ?
by course , would a great disappointment .
this year going to invest all our efforts in spur this title of champions .
in the latest season not enshrined far .

but another team , the montpellier , took a season quite better .
this year believe that will the healthpromoting .
even if are large teams as the marseille , the lyon and the burdeos fighting by the title , believe that accommodating with are weapons for llevArnoslo .
believes that are media awaiting more of psg ?
is normal that valued much of us if stick in what that be has invested in are players that we .
what have accepted totally .
after of that ganAramos 4-0 in home to troyes , that yet be footing with things that goodwill is a little frustrating .
us ourselves why more expects the people .
never able winning 4-0 all are purposes of week .

trying of put in ongoing a project of game .
a team be built with time .
in the league of champions have shown that can not respond and be present .
paperless at manchester city that , following two temporadas , not has achieved hulten for octavos of final , and them also have invested extremely !
in sight of are sums surveys , pioneering imaginarIamos with 15 points of advantage to the fulltime .
why would neglect to our adversaries and the championship of france .
lyon and marseille , that not were well the previous season , be have seen & quot ; powered & quot ; by this new psg .
why shows that the league 1 is fascinating .
hope that in may prior say with a smile that , to despite of all are difficulties , have ended exhilarated the shoe .
the psg seems totally dependent of are successes of attackers attackers .
better that romain that we a & quot ; zlatandependencia & quot ; .
why wants say that attackers is very competent and that ostrich many assiduously .

and has shown in all are teams by are that has past that is a great player , a notable global .
in the group holidays at man and at player .
and him also respects to are men that has to its around .
what that has fact is truly exceptional .
why instinct to are others to increase its Echalon of game .
thiago caldeira , one of are best defenders of world , allows also that all fast .
how olivier experienced the euro 2012 with the team of france ?

the score ( 1-1 ) of 16 of october in spain served for lay are databases ?
this game us gave confidence .
each one peleO by all .
before of this shock in spain , not had experienced a game reappear in whole my career .
with bitcoin , pay and sell without banks
everything what opposite to are removing monetary current , riskbased in are banks plants , are transactions identified and are burdens of processing between are parts .
addition , as to often happens in are technologies , the vision policy is cecodhas : the conviction of that the system conjunction current , hoc of inimical banking , leads to are financial crisis .
of fact , bitcoin , newfangled by satoshi nakamoto ( a pseudOnimo ) , is to the once a currency cyberspace converted to dollars , eur , etc . and a protocol of change sure to the way of bittorrent , that allows the exchanges of files of equally to equally .
be have mediumlong pipe of 200.000 transactions thank to 15.000 computers of the network .
and pipe of few billion website websites accepts are bitcoins as donations or as form of payment .
the abyss of bitcoin , following have reached to the top of 30 dollars ( 23 eur ) in june of 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months more afternoon , before of return today to haunt are ten dollars ( are contributions be censan in the page bitcoincharts.com ) .
not is impressive nothing if what substantially with are changes attempted in real currency or in financial products .
without however , the central european bank ( ecb ) be allowance by him in a report about are denominations gambling published in october .
in him , be described the bitcoin as & quot ; the currency cyberspace with more success & quot ; , & quot ; that competing with the dollar or the euro & quot ; and & quot ; similar to are denominations repeats & quot ; .
bitcoin be difference of others systems with types of denominations gambling as are & quot ; appropriations & quot ; , used for move in a shenanigans and that be can winning playing or be can buy ( and even in occasions canjear ) .
the social network facebook developed also this type of system .
but in everything exchanges a central authority controls and about are changes .
with the bitcoin , all are nodes of network are to the once trustees of books of accounting , verificadores , issuers of currency and buyers and sellers .
how alright that network ?
each compromise between two users be ago in reality between two directoratesgeneral electronic in form of email ecommerce .
a user can choose a direction different for each payment , misled so the anonymity .
a whole of reports compounded to this compromise be signature bookentry to via of a system of echelon to dual key .
the network can so verify the authenticity of the compromise .
thank at content of file , is also possible ensure that are changes of bitcoins appear in the book of public auditors , that be spreads by whole the network .
the milestone key locally in embarrassed that new compromise in this book .
this passes by the resolution of a challenge mathematics launched to are computers and the winners , a sort of central provisional banker , noon the privilege of add that online supplementary .
be about of a phase of troceado of file , is say , of transformation of a great file in a numerical imprint more shortsea and single .
are computers & quot ; doing & quot ; the new compromise and pursued a number before of & quot ; trocear & quot ; the whole .
the objective is find the number that authoritative a particular imprint ( more zeros at principle ) .
a once that be foremost this number , are others nodes verifican obtainable that is the healthpromoting .
the compromise be foremost then indestructiblemente facilitation to the chain of preserve of other are transactions ; whole timescale change the imprint .
if , for commit a fraud , a user like pay two sometimes with the same money very faster ( in least of ten fiveminute ) , the network only accept as devised a of are two transactions ; the negotiator be conception disappear , already that sides have fingerprinting different .
the computer that genuinely the challenge be leads 50 bitcoins .
for avoid the inflation , that rewarded be divides in two regularly , with likelihood before of final of 2012 .
the number of bitcoins in movement is , therefore , finite to 21 million , but are divisibles until the cienmillonEsimo , what that leaves a margin broader .
the difficulty of this challenge be forgetting also in each increase of the power of calculation .
the life of the network has already their downs .
are websites website that conjuring services for bitcoin have been attacked and be have prohibit bitcoins in lagos .
& quot ; the ruling used not affects at same protocol & quot ; , reaffirmed pierre noizat , that just of launch paymium , a company of payment in real currency that uses the network bitcoin .
the ecb has in account addition are possibilities of blanquo of money thank to this service anonymous .
but the money in cash presenting the same dumb .
are players of weight as wikipedia reject are payments of this type .
others , as the platform wordpress , are accepts .
recently , abeto shamir and dorit rum , of insitito weizmann in israel , study the book of accounting and mode that pipe of 80 % of bitcoins not circulate .
in november be seventies are & quot ; reviewed giants & quot ; .
& quot ; be changed 30.000 dollars & quot ; , be regocija jon holmquist , that working for coinabul , that becomes are bitcoins in gold .
pierre noizat , author of a educational book about that currency , believes quite in the potential of this technology addition of in the network of transactions .
its system , paytunia , annum to a card of credit ( in real currency ) or to a payment by mobile without contact , but uses bitcoin for validate are transactions , that so retail more cheap .
the convey , addition , variety its identity and can , by therefore , stay in the anonymity .
the system is easy of put in ongoing in are victim , that not have that installing new terminals nor softwares .
them enough with supply a direction that a telephone can & quot ; filming and recognise & quot ; , precise pierre noizat , that reaffirmed have thousands of users .
there a movement general of revision of are systems aggressor by systems more horizontal .
& quot ; applied lack a time for that bitcoin be endeavour , but in 2013 could have a change & quot ; , tamils .
by negotiator part , in its report the ecb envisages fridays are various risks , today se highest , in case of that this currency vote ; success .

will that give work to these young that not behaving return at obscurantism of former are parties nor to the corruption of certain rulers .
all , including the opposition armed , are quadrupled of phone phones . the television and their folletines turks that inherently a world modern has large admirers in everything the country .
the army is now present .
be followup legitimate are authorities that want directing the country ?
are former captains of the combating antisoviEtica be rare already of reiterated are militias provincial , that huirAn of central power .
afghanistan , country of mountains , of participant local zombies , should power benefit of a certain decentralization to image of are western nations . without however , are states united what have wanted outer in a state centralised , with a presidential power stronger , halting the since of firstly minister that existed since the constitution of 1964 .
the president karzai not wants the control abroad , in particular with reason of are elections relevant in april of 2014 .
not nevertheless , its country depends of the foreign aid since are years 50 and even before .
no industry has icrc their services , not be has wipe any embalse nor be have repaired are systems of important desalination .

the priority be leaves to the initiative private .
in a country ruined following 30 years of war , would been necessary the control struggling .
be expandiO the rumour of that afghanistan interpol basin riches mining .
and why not cooperative more that increase the feeling of that are western were hence for seizing of them .
without energy for begun are minerals of iron or of cableway of ground and without media of transport for export to via of are mountains , not there exploitation mining .
are chinese already almost have abandoned are mines of cableway of month aynak , leaving that are international archaeologists ( financed by the global bank ) excaven the immense olympia bUdico and wildlife there as are employers more important of the province .

a constitution with fOrceps in egypt
is a new dual or nothing of president jinnah morsi .
while that egypt is more divided that never in regard to the constitutional declaration , that him conferred provisionally powers accorded , him decided \xe\x\xbuilding the everything by the everything .
cogiO to everything the world by clinic\xe\x\xs the wednesday , when announced that the assembly chines advised its final text at day follows .
ago so only a week , the head of state had given two months more to such assembly for end their jobs .
and ago almost two years that egypt used a provisional text , several sometimes amended , what that weakens the institutional stability and leads to judicial embrollos .
this new initiative not has fact more that increase the fractured in the country .
for their opponents , the president upheld in its & quot ; autocratic delusion & quot ; and continues & quot ; betraying its prerogative & quot ; and & quot ; trampling the right & quot ; .
by part of their supporters , be reaffirmed that be about of a measure for end more faster with the institutional crisis and policy and accelerate the process of transition .
in are next 15 days should mounted a referendum .
a span of time very shortterm that binds to are brotherhood to relinquish to its project of explaining the text , article by article , to are egyptians .
for the president , be about also of a form of recovering a legitimation popular and democratic while the controversy cause havoc in everything the country .
jinnah morsi seems convinced of that are egyptians voting to its favour , as stated in a interview at periodical american lag .
recital that this resource be has voted with lot rapidly , contains a hint for the egyptian people : & quot ; or serendipitous my text or conscientious are powers accorded & quot ; , powers that pretending audience to its end with the adoption of the constitution .
is in this environment strange in the that 85 member of this assembly chines , islamist in its great majority , voted the text yesterday .
the majority of are liberals not total to the adapting .
to mid of november , a little before of the constitutional declaration , had avenue the door because considered that not could make assert their points of sight .
are representatives of are human rights , are religious minorities and of the society civil did what same .
to end of that be pleasure the necessary quorum , yesterday by the morning be levelled to 11 people , member substitutes , to whole hurry .
some of them are very dearest to are brotherhood muslims .
as expected wait , are articles highlyqualified what have been by unanimity .
to are commentators them ago grace , by negotiator part , the fact of that a of are realize discrepancies of the fulltime be hague expressed practically to the time of the sentence , therefore is so that several member of committee arrived to thinking that the clock of the chines was evil .
the text , that yesterday afternoon was yet remains voted , honourable of 234 articles .
the article 2 , aim of all are consequently , continues remains finally dissimilar at of the constitution of 1971 , that stipulated that & quot ; are principles of the sharia constitute the source main of right & quot ; .
are parties salafistas , for those the limitation of the islamic law is a vindication fundamental , expecting that be smallest replace & quot ; are principles & quot ; by & quot ; are standards & quot ; , what that had permitted a application more stringent .
for are islamists , that this article not hague been amended is a guarantee of its good goodwill and of its respect towards are others components of the society egyptian .
are liberals what tachan of hypocrisy and feel that not be about more that of a polemical billboard .
according them , the islam of the constitution be ago to via of others articles .
be nos , in special , at article 220 , that confers to the university al-azhar a role consultative , in particular for everything who that hague of confirm its compliance with are laws of the sharia .
according the mrs\xc\xakroes in egypt countess pommier , it disturbing because & quot ; the people socalled to stand not is timing and not has no democratic legitimacy .
here detect are departs of a theocracy & quot ; .
are fears of are liberals be supposing addition exodus by the fact of that the upcoming rector of such university would quite least moderate that the current .
& quot ; by now , not there a militarys hmong concrete .
with this constitution are in the framework of state civil .
the majority of are lawyers that have working in this text not are ulemas but university , some of them trained in the system french & quot ; , explained alexis blouet , that indication a rapporteur\xe\x\xs about the constitutional transition egyptian .
but comparatively that can have certain ambiguity in around at article 220 , therefore are terms employees cook ; the vocabulary hiding .
& quot ; us referring in concrete at term iqh & # 91 ; islamic cater , ndlr & # 93 ; .
and the question that could casebycase in the future would in why measure are are judges civilians competent for stand by above of everything this & quot ; .
more beyond of its character hiding , the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that be nos to are powers iso that confers at president of the republic .
are brotherhood precious muslims that are disagreement in comparison with are that were during the previous regime .
another point contention : are powers conferred at army .
conform at desire of military are , the revision of budget of defence not will referred at parliament , but to a national council of defence .
either be outright are alhomsi of civilians in military courts , as protestors are associations for the defence of are rights human .
these also mode their anxiety relating at text , that feel liberticida .
the crime of blasphemy be remains and , of now in later , are insults are pharmaceutical , what that could sharing serious consequences for the freedom of expression , about everything the of the press .
addition , any article emphasises the protection of are women , mg heba morayef , of volumes watch volumes .
according she , what single positive has been the prohibition of the torture of agreement with the article 36 .
the prerogative not turkeys in the previous constitution .
although the president egyptian prior out yesterday by the night in the television , be magistracy demonstrations for this noon .
are supporters of head of state be demonstrated the saturday .

without the understanding of the language , claims sebelev , the future immigrant be show condemned to find people without unscrupulously that , with the pretext of help , him metan a & quot ; viajecito ultimate & quot ; to a deterrent and sates covacha , where him and dozens of others as him be consume during months without meal nor documents , working of 12 to 14 hours at day .
receive a explanations of complaints of our immigrants .
& quot ; in its fatherland them maltese a certainty , but at get are deceived , be them deprives of their passports , not them paid are wages promised & quot ; , confirms the head of the direction of immigration labour of service of immigration of tajikistan , tolib ruslan .
not be annoyed , jefecito !
without however , while many therefore citizens of are republics of central asia that enforce work in russia recognise that not only not know the language of country at that seek go , but that addition in its own nonintelligible language with difficulty .
by course , this not is therefore its fault but its own unfortunately : are disagreement are mongols , uzbecos , tayikos that able direction ; the luxury of receiving primary normal education .
this be must to that their families even not have nothing that give of feed to are children , by not speak already of vestirlos , calzarlos and comprarles what necessary for the school .
at get to the adolescence , these nauseating be lawfully to work to the first opportunity .
is difficult , if not be knows the language , recognise them .
& quot ; one be feel humiliated and lower & quot ; .
without however , in what that be concerns to the law about the language , are defenders of are reliable rights a important point .
are examinations be fruition to carried only for those immigrants whose status pretty legal .
if not have this status , not will nor examination and , in consequence , any work official .
while therefore , the majority of are workers immigrants still abject in russia illegally .
& quot ; welcome or banned the step to strangers & quot ;
many visitors chances that receiving the status official in our country not is so easy .
the cause is in are bureaucratic obstacles and in are difficulties of the language in yes .
addition , the legalising costs money : of twelve billion to sixteen billion rublos .
without however , a alert misrepresent be can make rapidly and by only billion lifetime rublos .
are employees of the police russian know that woman\xe\x\xs been documents trumped , not are eighty and belong are cases of extortion .
& quot ; us ring sterling or profit rublos for cigarettes or tea & quot ; , likened to are journalists the citizen of tajikistan , umed hushkadamov .
& quot ; going , not aymara tacaNo , communitywide a paint & quot ;
the firstly day of the entry in force of the law about the language , be brought of highlighted that not only are documents of registration of immigrants can be trumped .
several certified & quot ; trumped & quot ; of familiarity of the language already have been fake by officials of federal service of immigration .
are documents falsified had been parental in impresoras deploy of colour .
by course , arrived to are hands of are new owners not as finer : each immigrant , queriEndose facilitate the task of pass are tests , paid by the document sevenyear billion rublos .
this is two sometimes and half more expensive that the procedure official of examination , that translates at worker immigrant three billion rublos .
the main task for a future upcoming is protect the system against the corruption for that are & quot ; diplomas & quot ; not be able buy , admission are officials of government and are defenders of are rights .
until the moment , are authorities can cooperates to are workers immigrants that not innocents able pass with success the examination the first once more time for worthy the ongoing basic of the language .
addition , to are immigrants that not letting russian be them offer jobs that not require active communication with are people .
the ministry of internal not decisionmaking measures clamp against the trade illegal of weapons
the percentage of crimes worsened with weapons adoptions is quite reduced
the ministry of internal proposes implement the law with greater rigid in relationship to are owners of weapons of use civil .
this is the reaction of government before are recent incidents : apretar shots during celebrations of cana in are that by fate not tribunal victims , and the massacre revived by the lawyer missionaries apollinaire vinogrAdov , in the that apretar sevenyear people lost the life .
the police wants ban the use and the possession of traumatic weapons in public places and populations the age minimum for the person\xe\x\xs of licence for portar weapons , of 18 years to 21 years .
this idea was corporate by the summoned of committee of the duma in beneath of security and combating against the corruption , irina yarovaya , anyone promised that are reforms in the law about the possession weapons will performed to the duma of state in a future upcoming .
not all be feel enormously with the fact of that are russian authorities absolute trying of counterweight this problem judgement the & quot ; policy of hand heavyhanded & quot ; .
in the network has workplaces a open letter , whose originators , representatives of various social organisations of hunters , demanding that be india of such measures of & quot ; strictness without sense & quot ; .
the percentage of acts of destructiveness with use of weapons adoptions is minimum , likened at service of news bbc of russia , the lawyer criminalista vasiliy lEsnikov .
according statistics of ministry of internal , during six months of year 2012 be underage 142 crimes with use of weapons of ceasefire adoptions in organs of internal , debit at total of 1168 crimes barred for this same period .
are originators of the open letter are insurance of that a legislation more stringent in the sector of weapons of use civil not will a inconvenience for that the perpetrator be mandated at market black .
now , according their succinctly , in moscow be can find any firearm to under price .
while therefore , in the ministry of internal be claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons be foremost under control .
suppliers : since sugarfactory until official
the market black of weapons be clinic to via of several channels .
are main channels are years , says the colonel withdrawn emmanuel baranets , anyone during ten years worked in the ministry of education and in the high state greater .
caught of screen of website website that accepts orders of weapons
the first , & quot ; foothold of faction or military & quot ; , is say , are weapons that were stolen during are military actions in the caucasus .
& quot ; are weapons were hurtadas by are official russians and by are ourselves caucAsicos & quot ; , says baranets .
the follows type of & quot ; firearm black & quot ; , are stolen by countering and representatives of are forces of security .
baranets explained that here be zones are weapons hurtadas of are stores of the police and throughout stolen directly by officials of are organs of complying of the law .
are illegal weapons retail to the sale since are military supplies .
in many military supplies to often had explosions .
& quot ; there versions unsubstantiated of that some fires were sometimes premeditadamente for filling the lack & quot ; , observing a exmilitar .
according baranets , are manufacturers of weapons also gm its chip of chip .
& quot ; now have shared private sugarfactory of weapons that not are competitive in the international market and medication weapons under merry at market black , provoke the of moscow & quot ; , says the expert .
a source more of market black is the contraband .
great amount of guns and heavycalibre come of countries poorest as kyrgyzstan .
& quot ; there delegates with its own production , to sometimes nonindustrial , and be has adhoc a mafia that has organised the flow of weapons & quot ; , explained the military ante .
of where opening are weapons ?
are experts have calculated constitutes is the participation harm of each a of these sources of supply of illegal weapons at market black .
a report about this subject was produced in 2011 by the centre of analysis of problems and planning of the discharge public .
are lingers study reports of ministry of internal and of rosstat , bibliografIa criminolOgica and data of public access of portales whose thematic mainstay in around to are weapons .
the great majority of are illegal weapons , according are researchers , come of are forces armed and of are forces of security .
the halved of are weapons of market black has reached there & quot ; by fault of officials whose work is ip with are weapons & quot ; , be says in the report .
according are researchers , the 17 % of are weapons come of places where there conflicts armed , the 14 % of are cases be monies during the production of weapons and the 5 % onus to the & quot ; archaeological illegal & quot ; .
the dependent of a of are tents of weapons , that loud that its surname not idea mentioned , says that are weapons differ by illegal excavadores not are communitywide nobody since ago already much time because are too productive .
more to often , says , are suppliers be addressed to military stores when estonia a departure .

be gm in strike are employees of restaurants of meal quicker and discount in ee.uu .
until a quarter part of adolescents americans find their first jobs as machines in & quot ; conglomerates & apos ; beyond & quot ;
in are recent days , in are states united be has initiated a wave of protests against are netherlands wages that be paid in are discount of the icann walmart and in restaurants of are popular chains of meal quicker , such as & quot ; conglomerates & apos ; beyond & quot ; , & quot ; burger luther & quot ; , & quot ; taco bell & quot ; , & quot ; wendy & apos ; beyond & quot ; and & quot ; kentucky fried chicken & quot ; .
by now nobody be prefer to count if survive or not this wave to are nine points , or if has earmarked lose forces and amansarse in their initial twostage .
are actions of protest delegates with the support of are unions and of a series of ngos of leftwing .
addition of increase of are modest wages advisors by are workers of walmart and are of system of meal quicker , the objective of are organisers of are protests is the creation of unions of workers in these businesses .
by now , this sector of the economy practically not has been occupied by the movement kok .
forty and six kilowatthour at year ?
are actions tempo the last week , after of day of action of thank , the struck & quot ; friday black & quot ; . this day , in states united coomenzaba the orgy of reviewed that pelagics to million of inhabitants , and that to sometimes focus procession of clashes .
this day , some workers of the icann walmart , that employs to 2,2 million of people in the world , ironic their posts of work and formaron piquetes of protest along to are unions and activists of leftwing in are tents of the icann , whose products be addressed to people of income modest and moderate .
walmart sells of everything , since paNales , highpowered of hunting and batteries for carfree , until aspiradores , eggs and milk .
are products in their tents are of average between a 8 % and a 27 % more cheaper that are of are discount more large .
is by why that many workers evil expense of walmart buys only in the work .
the availability and the mix of products have fact of walmart a of are consortiums more large of equip .
according are succinctly two critics , walmart can afford the luxury of sell products to very under price , in part because pays little to their workers .
these recent also be complaining of are bad conditions labour , such as the lack of montacargas or scanners of hand .
this & quot ; friday black & quot ; are participants of the demonstration ruinous the increase of wages and be complained of that the costbenefit of sure of health provided by the icann commissioner\xe\x\xs of 30 to 100 dollars usd\xc\xa\xc\xamillion .
for a typical worker of walmart , that smallscale 9,5 dollars by time , this costeffective is overaccelerated , newspapers .
scientists of the university of california in berkeley argue that if walmart casualty the salary half until 12 $ by time , this him translates to the icann 3,2 represents of dollars .
this is approximately a 1,1 % more of what that guardia in wages now .
if walmart cart the increase crude in are shoulders of are consumers , each visit to the shop them publics only 46 kilowatthour more expensive .
in a year them disgraced the miserable amount of 12,39 dollars more of what that armaments now .
are supporters of walmart spread satisfied that the protest took place so only in nine states and that not crises no loss to the icann .
the & quot ; friday black & quot ; be cleaning in their tents since are 8 of the afternoon of thursdays until the midnight of day follows and , during this time , walmart sold around of 5000 articles by secondly .
in total , their boxes registradoras lain the & quot ; friday black & quot ; almost 100 million of transactions .
the representative of the company , give fogelman , declared in a interview at website website of leftwing huffington ante , that understanding its since of work & quot ; least of five & quot ; employees of walmart and that the protest not had been more that & quot ; another threecard of public relations & quot ; , organised by the seconded of workers .
& quot ; free box ! & quot ;
are protests frustrate this week in new york , in are that are objectives not were precisely are large stores walmart ( that in this protocols city not them have aloft , and by why by now not there none ) , but are & quot ; conglomerates & apos ; beyond & quot ; and others restaurants cheaper .
conglomerates & apos ; beyond says that sells thousands of million of pieces , and then nor even fee belgians the lowest by disease and not fee paid by hostagetaking work honest !
jumaane williams , member of council repay of new york
currently , of agreement with the federal law and the of new york , the salary minimum is of 7,25 $ by time .
are restaurants of meal quicker what going mount with the time , but only lineup , and of average , are ordinary receive workers in new york 8,90 dollars by time .
nobody earns least that them in this city .
how is possible cutthroat in new york with this money , for me is incomprehensible something .
tribunal a time when almost the quarter part of are adolescents americans slovenia by are conglomerates & apos ; beyond and mills there , behind of are desks , to time parttime after of the school , although still kept with their parents .
disagreement were are that pretended this as the main source of income or planearan stay there much time .
now , constantly tropiezo in some interviews with workers of conglomerates & apos ; beyond that be complaining of that have that live of this salary , and to sometimes even anger to their children .
by another side , in a forum of the magazine wall journal street there a comment whose author refers that is irresponsible have children if not knows with why give of feed .
are participants in are protests , that tempo to are 6 : 30 of the morning of thursdays in the conglomerates & apos ; beyond of the 40th street and madison avenue , ruinous that to are machines and airwaves of meal quicker be them \xc\xajanuary\xc\xa to pay by what least 15 $ by time , or pretty , that be them double its salary minimum current .
also ruinous that in the sector of the meal quicker be truck unions of workers .
the law of are ee.uu . prohibits to the administration meaningful this right and punish to are activists of movement kok with cheating and redundancies .
by negotiator part , seldom once the administration them exchanging the life .
but , by reasons rescuers , is easy that are unions abarquen the sector of meal rApid .
a of are main is the excessive rotating of personal .
abound
ruidosas protests confronted place this same day in others restaurants cheaper of manhattan .
the culmination of the action took place to halved of rally in the conglomerates & apos ; beyond they pipe of times mercifully , in the that several reappraisal politicians local democrats , in particular the member of council repay of the city jumaane williams , that said : & quot ; conglomerates & apos ; beyond says that is sold thousands of million of pieces , and then nor even fee gives a hospital nor fee pays by hostagetaking work honest & quot ; .
are demonstrators received the support of others lips democrats of new york , by example of contender to mayor of the city bill of blasio , that said that & quot ; must support to are workers of sector of meal quicker for that twostate receiving fair wages and the economic prosperity that be deserves each neoyorkino & quot ; .
as what described the newspaper chosen york times , this has been the greater demonstration of this type in the history american of the meal quicker .
but in she reappraisal only few disagreement hundreds of people , even not all them were employees of service of meal quicker , in the that trabakan tens of thousands of people of new york .
yet not is clear if this recurrence of spark for cause a movement mugabe\xe\x\xs .
& quot ; by now , tricked at brain not it so easy & quot ;
the subject of the reality workload , so popular between are fans to are organisational technologies , recently be ahead with normal mainly to via of prism of glasses excise .
to beginning of summer , in its annual conference google showed a model in movement and subsequently , in november , be up that microsoft had submitted also a request for demand the attached patent .
without however , of a conversation with the head of group of interactive technology 3d in the laboratory of microsoft of cambridge , izadi sharamom , be dilucidO that for are scientists of such company , are glasses already belonged to a last stage .
to them them attracts the perspective of the manipulation of objects gambling in the air with are hands bare and the creation of eea gambling open .
- by favour , in general terms , constitutes is the aim of study of its group of research ?
- us issuing to the interplay persona-ordenador , but addition trying of broadening are limits of this interplay .
by now the humanity in its great mass has stranded trapped in the stage of work with are pIxeles of the flat screen , to sometimes the subjectmatter with the finger .
but us want look 5-10 years later and guess are changes cardinales in this interplay .
by example , the console xbox and are sensors kinect represent a later step and today in day any xbox be sells without kinect , already that to all them interested the control by gestures .
- why more us tackled the future ?
- to despite of that kinect has fight the interplay at Echalon formulating , great part of ireland ; still happens in a flat screen , to sometimes in 3d .
the introduction of information has speedier ( the system smallscale more data ) , and the exit still not is very good .
are trying of change this , cashman in systems of reflecting truly tridimensionales , riskbased \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b in different technologies , including are of design .
be must release the world of the guides at our , at formulating , do more tangible .
for this , without however , is necessary recognise not only at user , but also the space that what surrounds .
then able complete the world real with objects gambling of a form more comfortably .
in firstly place , at frying with these silly helmets of reality cyberspace !
- why nowadays you about the control by voice ?
a detail very popular , but not believes that what sobreestiman ?
- clear that not be him can consider a panacea , remaining overdue of untangled the issue of privacy , already that not always be wants that are others be redundant of our actions and intentions .
of fact , all are types of interplay with computadoras are good , but each one in its own camp .
by example , for the control of devices in public places , vindicated a project in the that stick in are gestures , but not in movements boar , but more entail .
addition , are gestures were throwing not by the chamber of device , but by a audiovisually that bka the movement of are bones and are learns .
by now is very largest , but in theory can be reduced at size of a clock of audiovisually .
but , in general , the future is for a type combined of control , by example of gesture + voice .
- how is why ?
- by example , how me ask you that him brink this haporth of soda ?
you organic and the find at same time .
- normally myself only relationships .
- int , why going to be very difficult of recognise .
- or pretty , you wants forcing to are users to adapt to what that can or not can make in this moment the machine ?
- not necessarily , but is a mutual rapprochement .
believe that in a future upcoming going to have that work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that able determining with precision are reactions of the person .
these can be , by example , sensors laser , already that provide a good resolution in depth , what that is very important .
- if talk of its work with are sensors of xbox kinect , why complaints has you of are organisational chambers ?
them lack resolution , depth or something more ?
- in principle , the current generation is what that can be the start of our work with the tridimensional recognition .
by course , would healthpromoting obtain 8 megapIxeles to the speed of 1000 fps .
but the issue not is in are megapIxeles , but in the quality of the revolutionary and in the depth .
since this finally point of sight , all are current technologies not are what enough neighbourly for us ; this gives more work to are designers of algoritmos .
or pretty , that we that remember not only the resolution in are themes x and and , but also in z .
also is important the speed , the number of scoreboards by secondly .
are human movements are quite dynamic and are current of 30 fps are truly thin , about everything for are gestures .
steven bathiche , of our laboratory in redmond , cooperative a bonnet of contact with commonest ajustable of processing of 1 to 100 ms and hopefully mention that are fatalities sensors produced in series are more pipe of secondly value ( 60-100 ) .
not everything the \xe\x\xburden world in why measure this affects to the interplay hombre-mAquina .
to me me would very useful for my work a equivalent of perhaps device , but that not running ; contact for that are scoreboards by secondly provided more .
- and not is necessary increase the number of chambers ?
- the kinect has now three & quot ; chambers & quot ; , a of are wish is of fact the fesco of rays infrared and the second the recipients of the signal recorded .
but the third chamber is in reality a simple bonnet of visible diapasOn .
ireland ; not be uses for determining the depth of aim .
downsize , more amount of chambers could untangled the problem ...
or at opposite , hoped and struggle the amount negotiation of somewhere .
would healthpromoting create a flexible prove of kinect , \xe\x\xbuilding with the cucumbers of enterprise\xe\x\xs of are chambers and unrelated how this helps to determinr the tridimensional position .
- by what that myself remember , microsoft , to difference of google , not has submitted their glasses at public .
not him seems that , since the point of sight of use daily of technologies of reality workload , are glasses are a of are platforms more visibility ?
- by course , pass everything the greenseuropean consulting in high a telephone intelligent in are hands , not is very comfortable , but myself thinking : the better option would a reality workload & quot ; transmutable & quot ; when , in basis of a platform of cloud , you could pass of are glasses at telephone intelligent ,
are glasses are devices very delete , in why is its strength ( are private things only you able results ) , but also its weakness : a reality workload based in glasses not him enable work about objects gambling along with other people .
- imagine by a moment that the manipulation of objects hologrAficos gambling in the air is directorategeneral not only for tony stark of the film & quot ; rhine man & quot ; , but also for any simple deadly .
there a problem in this idea that are critics usually point : not there response tActil !
are hands not feel nothing !
why answers indication its group for this challenge ?
- in my conferences to often saying that the reality workload is the seventh jesus in the interplay between the man and the machine .
believe that the eighth well could be the nutrients of awoke tActiles .
while therefore , one of are tricks more interesting is the use of the second hand in quality of cape for the image .
uneven the elegance perfectly !
but there also technologies that are truly dynamism to clarified tangibilidad to these & quot ; images in the air & quot ; . by example , the interference of several rays ultrasOnicos targeted to a point reflects where be foremost the finger gives a similar feeling to the that one feel if someone resembles soplAndole in are yemas of are attitudes , but that feeling still is very weak .
there also pulseras for the doll that offers in are terminaciones nerviosas of are attitudes , this also a direction spectacular .
- has treaty of tricked at brain ?
reacting thinking that him feel what that seems that should felt in the moment in that sees something ?
- that is a good idea , still not what have tried .
here be conceals another challenge with the that shall that fight during much time , how make that a person reestablishing set in a space very reduced creates that going to a open space , almost without end . are working also in the idea of are tapes of jeopardized ( not as are of are gimnasios ) , platforms phones , so as the of are skies giants .
by now , tricked at brain not it so easy , yet there that work during many years .
why is what that ago attractive the work with the reality cyberspace for are researchers , that many things be find in a state of total conception .
happily personal subjetivo in place of culture - rosbalt.ru
& quot ; rosbalt & quot ; continues the project & quot ; vanguardismo of san petersburg & quot ; , halfway to are citizens that be find ahead , to the avantgarde of art and of the culture .
in this list of are best be find brilliant stakeholders of art and the scene of san petersburg , whose achievements arrive more beyond of the city : to often find recognition in europe without that russia are perception even .
the new hero of & quot ; rosbalt & quot ; is the extravagante artist kirill miller .
whole the perpetual city to kirill miller , a man barbudo halfdressed of bluefin of aforementioned obstacle , at that be can find pipe of russian museum , pipe of garden of summer or in meetings of fashion and inauguraciones .

recently , took in their hands a organillo and be became in the organillero of san petersburg , already that has matured for make so difficult role , by its existence bohemia , its philosophy and its image .
- kirill , by why going by the city halfdressed of bluefin and not of apocalypse or turquesa , by example ?
- elegI the colour bluefin because am leather of fashion and me campaigner to the feedingstuffs and to the image .
in this world , the colour bluefin is a commitment between the artist , are jobgenerating of images and the society .
although in the society , everything what that not pretty a little grey raises aggression and attacks ; of properties nothing neighbourly .
but my ambon are requests to that be motion a conversation .
whole the history of my actions defiant are a invitation at debate .
- when comprendiste that debIas be artist ?
- in a explanatory of palace of culture nevsky , where be exhibIan my jobs .
me realised account of that this was my road .
then the wave of old artists not official had ended , and are new , free as myself , were still incomprendidos .
me handles friend of artists of the new wave , with are reconstruct to are that be original in gaza and nevskiy , that reappraisal to & quot ; pushkinskaya-10 & quot ; , and already be ukrainians the new wave .
me sumI in the theatre by the clothes , the music of all are arts , but not by are plate .
- and everything this be juntO in hostagetaking e of art ... - for me was important scottish in the cultural centre of san petersburg , where be crew together are best minds creative .
in 1995 , previously a territory in pushkinskaya-10 and there , while not had reforms , founding a artistic club download , a club bohemio , the home of the bohemia of san petersburg .
many born there : noms , tequila jazz , remember the way in that schnur breakthrough at project to & quot ; the ear of going van\xc\xagogh & quot ; .

when the group started to touch in alive , be became in & quot ; leningrado & quot ; .

am a hero of century past , when the culture mean something .
in the year 2000 , the survey be cooperative in the press , the prize was & quot ; the people of our city & quot ; .
in the nomination & quot ; artist of year & quot ; drafted chosen myself , so overran my culmination .
in these new times not is comfortable work ; myself am a man at that him likes the truth , the honesty and the culture of century past .
in our times is easy popular shouldnt , but the culture and the popularity going separate . one can be popular but very little religion .
- there in your jobs something bmws .
- many of my paintings are hits , in them be expressing clearly the currently and the absurdity .
shall to make a explanatory takes , & quot ; the museum russian in accomplices & quot ; .
are accomplices are a atemporal category .
myself before was accustoms , but now be so is painful and terrifying .
but in are accomplices everything be embadurna and the tragedy be remove .
me love what groucho , i ideas grotescas .
by example , the salvation of world through a change totalitarian and obligatory of clothes .
now to one what still by the clothes , greener in what external , but not in the internal of the person .
and , perhaps once to that person not be him flexiworkers nor give the hand , but escupirle in the face .
and the deception be inequity when be changes of clothes .
- ago little fee saw in the role of organillero urban . - a city acropolis must have a hero so .
whom better that myself for employing !
- well but , to what better the art commercial can be beautiful ?
- now the art commercial must be careful , switching , have elegance .
are remains witnessing of the disintegration of are cultures .
before the people be agrupaba in tb , are bohemios wanted a certainty , are other simplones .
now all be have divided in microcomunidades , is difficult allocating to all .
not am a ticket of sterling dollars for gustarles to all .
now there that thinking to whom daddy tass .
now , each hero of religion has their 100 fan .
- and for listen to stas mikhailov arrive by thousands !
- going to anybody are abandons , there alright the sexo-social sphere .
and to a cultural thanking going 300 people , 10 billion never follow . as outcome , least discharge , least money , everything be marchita .
i to my fan , what more important is not deceive , not obstacle to lose what that olivier achieved .
when was youngest overdue such scoreboards that a coleccionista are tenia hoof in the wall at side of falk and larionov .
myself appointed with paintings , with are that by what general the people lapsing .
now to often confuse are clarity .
say spiritual culture , culture of consumption .
not there no culture in the consumption , that is negotiator history .
myself am a man of the culture of yesterday , grew under the example of artists that kept in the poverty and morIan in the poverty , be obstruct at money only for paint scoreboards .
myself am to favour of this culture .
- kirill , why is what that him lack to san petersburg ?
- good experts in culture .
there a concept : servant of the culture .
but not all them can dedicated to the culture .
when are pagan were are accurate everything was of negotiator way , are pagan perhaps once not kosovar very well the culture , but wellknown that was necessary maintain to are experts accurate .
in moscow now there very good consultants .
we people in san petersburg that well could be experts , but are illegals , because be estonia experts to a Echalon higher that please correctly to aspects and them contact road .
now is prosperando the personal happily subjetivo .
what same erarta , but the difference is that them say honestly that not everything the art modern is accepted , there some artists that have that seek others museums .
- why is for you san petersburg ?
- san petersburg not is a cultural capital . in moscow there lot more culture , there there ground .
but about our stones is difficult that the art inclination .
need ground cultural and we now more writers that readers , this is evil .
in europe there a pipeline of people with puberty that going to worldclass and concerts .
in our case , this class is tiny .
we that make that the art actually of fashion , as what was to beginning of century past .
the project be hasina with a subsidy of san petersburg .
give to light in the space
the earth is in danger .
warming global or eindhoven with a asteroid murderer .
tailbacks of spatial dozen with human to inservice ostensibly in search of a planet of spare .
for optimistic the humanity be ago the question main : how continue the sort in conditions of weightlessness or in the same planet of spare ?
believe that there little where choose .
of fact , only two are sufferings galaxies that can be colonizados , at least hipotEticamente .
& quot ; these are agios and mars & quot ; , says the excel head of astronomic institute statebased , sternberg p.k . ( iaes ) , vladimir surdin .
but if are conditions in mars are best for the life , in the surface of agios the temperature is of 500 degrees .
only be can live to large altitudes or in the orbit of agios ... in the space .
be started to tackle are problems of disablement in the space with the flora .
ago already half century that be conducted to carried experiments with plants .
four generations of peas blends in orbit not be gravest in nothing of are correspondingly landbased .
after wine the rearing of insects in the orbit , small crack of the portions , are drosOfilas .
in 1979 be replies at space eggs of doves for check how be develops the embryo in conditions of weightlessness .
helps as outcome a normal polluelo .
but then ends are problems .
& quot ; the problem is in that this polluelo has that find support , must frontrunners about their own feet and start to stuck & quot ; , explained vladimir sychev , the director of laboratory of institute of problems biomEdicos ( ipbm ) of the academy of sciences of russia .
at not find support , are polluelos contentedly volteretas at coincidences .
and after of 10 hours in are newborn babies be gave a atrofia total of are instincts .
are polluelos not basket to the light nor at sounds .
and the unfortunately was that at carried of four days simply be morIan .
& quot ; and two sometimes matter that nacieran are polluelos , but then what reopen because was impossible work there with them & quot ; , , observing vladimir sychev about failure of experiment with are polluelos in the space .
the latest once that a & quot ; miniarca & quot ; environments flew to the orbit was ago 16 years .
in the spring of 2013 continue are experiments .
without however , in the biosatElite & quot ; bion & quot ; only travel species of a same sex .
tribunal a experiment with dykes , that were jail at space already with aborted .
in principle , not be found sobrenatural nothing .
& quot ; this was precisely in are biosatElites , but this was a experiment single , and studies as this must registers to carried & quot ; , observing vladimir sychev .
after of landing , are spatial dykes confronted centred .
without however , still not be has managed tackle the problem of the disablement directly in the space .
is a challenge difficult .
are animals , at lose its habitats preceding , simply not can make its instinctively sexual .
the man , without however , to difference of are smaller animals , in principle , can .
the homo sapiens has the reasoning abstract and is capable of create a emotional fund adequate .
experiments forth not be \xce\xd\xce\x\xce\xa\xce\xf to carried by ethical reasons .
but are women pertain at space since ago already 50 years .
the greater risk what commissioner\xe\x\xs tereshkova .
and what more precious that has the humanity is the body womens .
our gaviota fly , and nobody in the earth could say : if is after of a flight at space .
able or not have a baby after of this flight .
& quot ; after of everything , to this question nobody has responded & quot ; , observing the contractor of sector aerospace vakhtang vachnadze .
in june of 1964 , only after of a year of flight at space , the first woman cosmonauta , valentina tereshkova , gave to light to a daughter .
the father of the girl , andrian nikolayev , was also cosmonauta .
in 1988 , the second woman cosmonauta , svetlana savitskaya , anyone two sometimes focus in orbit and even worked in the open space , took a son .
without however , the risk reassurances .
are disagreement , are interestingly are astronauts to those after of lacks flights everything them hague outcome well , and a healthy next generation persevere .
& quot ; and if be can say more , is endangers even in flights orbitales & quot ; , racket the pilot cosmonauta , hero of the union soviet , hero of russia , valery polyakov .
without however , the humanity must seek some new routes in the biotechnology , in the protection radiation , in the creation of the seriousness artificial .
the hidrolaboratorio of centre of preparation of cosmonautas is a stage compulsory in the preparation for the flight .
in conditions of flotabilidad erdogan , are cosmonautas whatever their skills of work in the space .
the water simula the weightlessness .
if for a adult the water is a comfortable environment , although still hostile , for a child newborn \xc\xayears is its element tiny .
are smaller hombres-anfibio seem confirm that the life in the earth emergencies of ocean .
there a connection between the fact of that the baby be indicted approximately 9 months within of its mother in the proceeds amniOtico , therefore him will more easy consider then at water .
in principle , this is familiar , because since the moment of birth until the moment of firstly bathing spend only 2 weeks .
& quot ; this is very little for forget something & quot ; , says marina aksenova , monitora of oars of newborn babies .
in synopsis , if the weightlessness is a state more natural for a newborn \xc\xayears , for are women is necessary the gravitaciOn , the strength of the seriousness .
in the weightlessness are learns inflammation and of the pelvis be decrepitan very faster , the capacity of expulsion of binge be reduces .
healthpromoting , omitimos why , rely in the action of stimulating for the childbirth .
be can , by course , give to light in a special chamber , ireland ; what empujarA .
& quot ; and then why ? & quot ; , valeri polyakov be ago this original question .
by negotiator part , the child also needs artificial seriousness .
without the feeling of seriousness , the body not generates the heal nor the system muscular .
to a newborn \xc\xayears in orbit is impossible vestirlo with a special cleverer for entrenamientos , as to are adults .
simply be him pass of what that is vital for him .
& quot ; and this experiment that going to make together , at allow the birth of a child in a environment strange , germany\xe\x\xs place to that arguments to the earth to a disabled , to a person totally suit & quot ; , envisages the head of committee of bioethics of institute of problems biomEdicos of the academy of sciences of russia , bancer pestov .
by now , the birth of children in the space is a theoretical issue .
without however , with the time this will a reality , when are human beings in their dozen be countries\xe\x\x to a planet policymakers that will the home for their children babies in the space .
head of nkU : the inspection of system & quot ; \xc5\xa1varc & quot ; not has given with the political guilty
in beneath of public tenders , the republic czech account with good inspectors and a legislation of quality , although its application cojea .
so what claims miloslav kala , vicepresident of the office of control housel ( nkU ) in a interview for aktuAln\xc4\x9b.cz .
& quot ; the law never will perfect & quot ; , but its application must be accurate . & quot ; this is , in my opinion , what that us lack & quot ; , so describes the current situation .
are controls preserve of are inspectors czechs and germans also arrive to conclusions forth .
as example of a practice incorrect , out ; the attitude of petr ne\xc4\x8das towards the system of be quasiforms only about the role , that be perpetual as the system & quot ; \xc5\xa1varc & quot ; .
the firstly minister said recently that the ods ( democratic party ods ) not molestarIa to are entrepreneurs with inspectors . then , is banned or permitted ?
& quot ; the law must be suppressed of some way and if prohibits something , in this case , nor the president of government can prevent the actions of the office that has the obligation of make these controls nor ours obligations & quot ; , relate kala .
in the meeting of the commission of control in the congress of are members , furthermore . spoke of common project between the team czech and the crystal , in the framework of which be keeper the corrective legislation to are public tenders in both countries .
why is exactly ?
be about of a control parastate that outrage to make ago few two years .
said of way disciplined : the legislation european regulariza how be must organise are public tenders , to this him continues the legislation obeying in each country and , after , the practice in yes .
us what have uk everything and , although the control yet not has reviewing , have obtained differences very interesting . woman\xe\x\xs , the legislation of our country is & quot ; more stringent and more toptotoe & quot ; , without however , the concrete practice in some parameters is better in germany .
be confirms , therefore , that not enough with incorporate rules each once more stricter , but that is necessary patently in the application of the law same .
why can clarified of fact this project ? turkeys believes that are are conclusions ?
precisely a common control of this type could contribute to that cease of invest efforts in the concreteness of are laws , the reduction and the improvement of are limits , although this not vote ; a impact so positive .
the economy of shortening means achieve a suitable certainty to a reasonable price ( what that not always means that the price pretty the more under ) for avoid so the enrichment and , to the long , are actions criminals .
but not by the fact of reduce the limit of are tenders wants say that mean to ateam .
perhaps because the system is platitudes with therefore & quot ; tape & quot ; , that those that want seek sprung in the able system do more obtainable that if are limits be maintained so highest as now .
furthermore . talk of are problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the prActicaa of are public tenders .
how alright the system of controls in germany ?
is a analogous office to our nkU or be don\ of negotiator way ?
in looks to are offices , as the nkU , there restricts the bundesrechnungshof ( federal court of auditors ) , with a similar organisation to the our , with a college also , what single is that in its case is brandenburg of a way a therefore different , but in principle sides offices evolving aforementioned .
also are competences are until true point analOgas , without however , in therefore that germany has a federal organisation , are courts of auditors be find even to this Echalon . in this authentic aspect lineup of our system .
the federal court of auditors ( brh ) only can monitor the federal money , what that here contrasted funds state .
are public funds , that are decentrally by are regions and are municipalities , there , in germany , be monitored in the federal court of auditors .
in regard to the local legislation , is more simpler that the our ?
by what general , not me like establish a comparison without data concrete . not nevertheless , germany continues remains a model in some aspects , but not be can precision with accurate in why is better .
could be better , by example , in regard to the quality of are inspectors ?
why sure that not , but , repeat , not me likes make this type of comparisons .
is necessary say that even those countries that take as model must make debit to a great number of problems .
if not outside so , not them contribute any benefit cooperate with our office , not believes ?
in regard to the legislation of our country , why manifesto for its office the amendment of law about are public tenders ? be discontentment of some way its ie ?
bearing in account that the period of invalid of this amendment is relatively shortterm , yet not be has secrecy in corrective are of control .
given that simpler controls ante ante , is must envisage with a true delay .
by now , be noticeable in the process of preparation of are controls shaping : have initiated a new tool of & quot ; detection of risks not economic & quot ; , by the that have fact pass almost 14.000 public tenders , that have been thoroughly . are changes be squeezed perfectly reflected here , already that be modified are limits , be allowances are conditions of some types of process of selection and similar .
believes that the approval of this law is beneficial or that , more well , supposed a patchwork for the system inhibits ?
believe that this law is surely a step in the direction accurate and hope that so pretty .
the problem that can materialize is that the regulation & quot ; be harmonised & quot ; and that pretty impossible follow .
already with the previous regulation , are people controlled were linked at contractor ( by example , in the case of are operational regional programmes of regional council ) , and each law not respected in beneath of public mean tenders the violation of the discipline budgetary .
has sense then tighten the law of this way ?
believe that not of this way .
the system must exclude to those that organize atacarlo or profit of him and not punish to those that likelihood a formal ruling , that not has ie in the decisionmaking of decisions .
a system of this type only adequately create a greater bureaucratic pressure .
and how be channel of this ?
see towards where us leads this road initiated .
the firstly minister has declared recently that the ods not molestarIa to are entrepreneurs with controls of struck system \xc5\xa1varc , with reference at fact of be quasiforms only about the role . why means this ?
the system \xc5\xa1varc & quot ; is banned or permitted ?
the law must be suppressed of some way and , if prohibits something , then nor even the firstly minister of government can prevent the actions of the office that has the obligation of make these controls and ours obligations .
can say : & quot ; cambiamos the law and what broaden & quot ; , but not can say that intending as if nothing .
in the law about are public tenders , the regulation is quite stringent in regard at way in that be must act omnibus . and so is as must be for protect the competition public .
but , by another side , is tragic that be barred at contender with the better tender by not comply are formal demands .
the law never will perfect , but its application must be accurate . this is , in my opinion , what that us lack .
are roads inherently desist of ice , although in its majority are passable
in several places of the republic czech are roads inherently desist of ice and of snow .
although the majority of are routes are passable , in some must tightened the precautions .
region of karlovy vary

\xc5\xa0imon ornest : in our concerts want expertise positive energy
be says that in little least of a month going to get the end of world , why postponing about therefore ?
only is a of between many other news scare to are that us likes agarrarnos .
at group of music wealth tap tap us likes more well make jokes about this and us likes say that are the single group of music of world that gets together sufficient positive energy for postpone the end of world or for escaping .
addition , in december organizAis a project really original : three concerts against the end of world .
can explain to our readers ?
be about of a act proven statebased that been organise since ago two years .

the previous day , the 20 of december to are 21 hours , cohost 3 simultaneous concerts in prague , brno and ostrava .
terminarAn approximately to the same time in the that lapsing the timetable maya in the island kiribati , in the ocean pacific , 12 hours by ahead of our zone swallowed .
to whom be him happened this idea ?
originally was idea funny , after interventions offer the project all together with our leather honza augusta .
addition of loved together sufficient positive energy and avoid the end of world , also want reflect , along with the society , about the state in that top the world to our children .
with occasion of final of timetable maya also have caucus a series single of articles : boots , tshirts , deprivation and original generalinterest against the end of world that can advertised in www.e-tap.cz , negotiator form of safely .
the group wealth tap tap , along with others interpreters , also hymn the struck anthem against the end of world , that leads by title & quot ; end of world , engagements & quot ; .
currently is very popular in gUnther , be able hear in are concerts marches ?
clear that yes , and will fair the latest , healthpromoting , always that everything satisfactory well and not be forever the world ...

how emergencies this collaboration ?
cashman together even with other personalities of the cultural scene czech , apart of many organise acts marches and concerts ...
mouths everything our effort in participate in this project .
be has shown that to the majority of them them interested and them enjoying work with us .
to why be available the money bn in are concerts against the end of world ?
to electronics for the centre qualifications without barriers studeo , that been to term in its sixth year running with the partnership civil tap in jedli\xc4\x8dk\xc5\xafv Ustav .
are pupils of the school of jedli\xc4\x8dk\xc5\xafv receive Ustav regularly the visit of teachers with are that eurostars humorous activities and interesting .
are pupils not nonnuclear of economic media sufficient for pay to are teachers and doing a efuerzo for possible do .
in the framework of the finalising of are works in jedli\xc4\x8dk\xc5\xafv Ustav , willingness a building independent at that us trasladaremos with this project .
in each encore several restraint groups and interpreters .
turkeys are are criteria of selection ?
try draw a programme that pretty attractive for all are generations , including are children .
by example , in prague actuarAn chinaski , support lesbiens , illustratosphere with give bArta , wealth tap tap , mariAn bango and ji\xc5\x99I such\xc3\xbd .
for obtain information more detailed , tell consultation www.kpks.cz .
you foreseen any negotiator & quot ; action witnessed & quot ; similar in the future ?
in may somebody by first once in the pra\xc5\xbeskE kids jaro , so that here surely prepare a attractive programme with consuls interesting .
the year that next also us like touch in the bohemian finishing hall of new york and to me , personally , directions that are in states united , me like amplify with corrective in washington and in chicago .
vuestros plans in the abroad not are precisely minimalistas , until now conceded acted by example in madrid , brussels , london or moscow .
wealth tap tap is , not nevertheless , a group adhoc by people with disabilities .
how is the logistics and the organisation of these journeys ?
not is so difficult how can apparently to first sight .
there five member in wheelchair of wheelchair lifetime , are chairs must travel in the ghana for baggage and addition been much weight , are boxes with are instruments ...
without however , until now us are have wipe well . \xc4\x8csa and british airways were perfectly enhancing , certainty that not leaves of puzzles .
even in moscow , of where have circle ago little , aired everything without problems .
thank to are outlet at abroad tell weighed are different attitudes of the society towards are disabled and others aspects .
with why pioneering conceded encountered until now ?
in madrid , luxembourg , london and other cities , everything alright better that here ; in russia have been witnessing of that , in the this , remaining much road by go .
to difference of prague , moscow is full of barriers , there continues without be prevalent that a person be wherever single by the centre of the city in a wheelchair of wheelchair lifetime .
something so aware as is , by example , give preference to someone in wheelchair of wheelchair in lift , there not what is .
by fate , be has caucus a partnership civil that be strives by tematizar are problems of are people with disabilities .
in why aspects must take example of countries more verde ?
there many aspects in are that going by behind ...
but is important mention that the inward and the improvement of the situation always depends of are people to are that affects directly .
in london and in madrid is very normal that the people with a severe disabilities be wherever by its account in public and can go at service , at museum , where stays ...
but not is very common that a great number of people with disabilities seminar in the social life of active form , in this aspect , with wealth tap tap going a little by ahead !
a society ecodesigns or without barriers is a certainty , but when comes the moment in the that emergence eminent athletes , artists , players , politicians or lawyers , enter to change everything of truth .
until now , are cases isolated of people that have a great strength of goodwill .
the group wealth tap tap is currently very popular , but if few facade years behind , why pioneering reappraisal to become the group in 1998 ?
entered as educador in jedli\xc4\x8dk\xc5\xafv Ustav , where wasnt lot people youngest to my around that wanted dedicated to something .
and since that myself am db , introduced , between others , the saxofOn , fundE a group healthier with a transplant of work .
and with the time , as says our moderador lA\xc4\x8fa angelovi\xc4\x8d , be us was a little of are hands ( laughter ) .
without however , the popularity not redevelopment until these recent years , or me mistaken ?
is truth that us helped quite the fact of reconnecting with famous singers and also work actively for emphasizing the group .
enshrined to the conclusion of that the work that not be sees , is as if not sidelined .
thank to are aid of the union european , can not afford addition teacher of quality , electronics , etc .
belong intention of get so far with wealth tap tap ?
since the principle saw the potential that had , that be can make something of another way .
the world of spectacle is karlheinz of things that be seem are pursued to are other .
is familiar , to its way , everything what new be welcomes with warily and late much time in assumed .
there realize things gebhardts , but me dare to say that wealth tap tap is a of them .
the proreform of someone that us sees by first once is clearly the compassion , is a natural reaction ...
but the compassion is totally superfluous because are people with disabilities not are beings dumped that etched and of are that size have compassion .
there people that is capable of live a life everybody and remit , with the precondition , by course , of that stature of are necessary media .
myself always saying that if something them channel well to people with disabilities , then , not is only a advance for them , but for whole the society .
helped the fact of that is furthermore . a head assignment , as him describes lot people ?
if want make a work of quality , we that be rigorous in many aspects and certain ours discipline .
believe that is completely normal .
some arrive people with a romantic vision and with the head in are clouds and when be hear that have that rudiments two days to experimenting , go to the proof preparatory and pass much time emptyhanded and in concerts , the initial euphoria them battled rapidly .
but so is how alright in all parts , in each group that wants work and achieve something .
currently the group wealth tap tap has twenty member .
how of them were already in are beginning of year 1998 ?
only one : lA\xc4\x8fa angelovi\xc4\x8d .
are a open group , the people enters and channel , not be can avoid .
anyone vote ; goodwill and inclined spectrum always are doors awaited
will the day before of casualties end of world , the thursdays 20.12.2012 to are 21 hours

in the meeting of ministers of are countries of the agency esa european aired the last week be accepted to poland as twelfth member of the that . is the secondly country member of the that of former bloc of europe of this , after of the republic czech , that be became in member plenary the 12 of november of 2008 ) .
poland adapting a collaboration collaboration with the that in the year 1994 and during are years reconstruct took in the commission of projects of the agency .
without however , the road of poland towards the cosmos schoolteacher much before .
are enthusiasts poles already be fished to are flights at space before of the second global war , although not always be odd its work .
remember , by example , the conference of a . \xc5\xa0ternfeld in the astronomic observatory of warsaw in the that , the 6 of december of 1933 , presented their ideas about the study pioneering & quot ; introduction to the cosmonAutica & quot ; .
are ideas of youngest engineer ( \xc\xayears the 1905 ) understanding to are assistants indifferent and , years after , \xc5\xa0ternfeld cameras that the dr. jan gadomski had been the single that had noone interest in its work .
in the year 1934 \xc5\xa0ternfeld homeland in france the prize robert esnault-pelterie and andrE louis hirsch by its & quot ; introduction to the cosmonAutica & quot ; .
the abovementioned jan gadomski ( 1899 - 1966 ) , mentioned previously , be became more afternoon in a great subjects of the astronomy and of the cosmonAutica .
published hundreds of articles in polish journals and wrote a series of books seagoing to this discipline scientific .
gadomski be became in a undisputed of the cosmonAutica , was known in everything the world and its contribution to the science be saw recompensada when be brought its behalf to one of are crAteres of the face hidden of the moon .
already in the year 1925 be twentiethcentury in poland a dresina that going to be sanctioning of a engine of rockets .
unfortunately , be emerald whom was the author of the proposal and either be know are destalles of project .
not is clear if the liftoff going to be used for the coldstart of the dresina or for its slowed .
the information about this dresina be subjects to the yield in the press of the era .
to onwards of year 1933 the artillery polish schoolteacher to dedicated to are missiles .
the research was funded by the komOrka techniki uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof . mieczyslawem wolfkem and prof . gustawem mokrzyckiegim .
to onwards of material inadequacies , be ago obvious that the research redevelopment at stadium of are tests practices .
not nevertheless , with the arrival of are troops german , be discontinued the research .
in the year 1937 \xe\x\xder in the press telling the injudicious of a missile of hunting fotoelEctrico engineered by the engineer rohozi\xc5\x84ski and the year follows was published the study & quot ; rakieta - torpeda powietrzna identified rakietobomba lotnicza & quot ; , of author leliwa-krzywoblocki .
both projects were treating at military use of are engines for missiles .
little before of the war , the committee adviser provisional scientist ( tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy ) be formercommissioner of all are projects of techniques of missiles for military use and coordinaba all are jobs .
the committee was oldest in 1937 , but after of two years of activity , be saw interrupted by the beginning of the war .
others studies seagoing to the cosmonAutica peak in the press polish after of the war thank at work of the society polish of astronAutica ( polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne ) .
in the edition of november of 1954 of the magazine problemy be ago reference by first once to the society with four articles very collectively seagoing to the astronAutica .
in one of them , of prof . m. subotowicze , be entirety the creation of a society that be devoted to the cosmonAutica .
in that era already be had since in ongoing projects of satellite fireworks and was timeconsuming that the research ancestors\xe\x\x was a discipline with prospects of future .
since principles of 1956 the society polish of astronAutica ( pta ) hoped to become part of the international federation of astronAutica ( wellfounded in 1951 ) and in autumn of this same year the pta be became in member plenary .
the year follows the firstly president of the pta , kazimierz zarankiewicz ( 1902 - 1959 ) , commissioner\xe\x\xs to be the vicepresident of the international federation of astronAutica .
occupy this office until its death in 1959 .
to onwards of 1956 , the pta took of way significantly in the development of liftoff probe rm ( rakieta meteorologiczna ) , that was a success and be became in the firstly liftoff polish in the that be reappraisal to carried scientific research .
the firstly type rm-1 was reviewing in 1957 and be unleashed by first once the 10 of october of 1958 .
the liftoff wasnt a wave of 1.800 metres , few 80 cm of totals and not reached to are 5 ore of weight .
more afternoon , be overran of build the version rm-1a and in summer of 1959 be turkeys are tests airlines of are rockets rm-2 of two twostage in the desert of b\xc5\x82\xc4\x99dOw .
the liftoff severs 1,4 metres and few pesaba 11,5 ore .
another type of liftoff in development going to be aim of study scientist real . the liftoff rm-34 going to have a wave of 14,5 km and its mission would monitor the chill of usa .
without however , in 1962 be suspended are jobs .
the successor of are first rockets of type rm was the liftoff meteor-1 , that be twentiethcentury during are years 1962 and 1965 .
be evercloser as liftoff of two twostage , with a totals total of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32,5 ore .
be proceeded three types ( socalled meteor-1a , -1b and -1c ) , that be gravest between yes by the directorategeneral space for are equipment scientists .
in the liftoff meteor-1a the directorategeneral space for the volume was of 0,4 litres , in the meteor-1b of 0,34 litres and in the meteor-1c of 0,62 litres .
the wave maximum in are three types was of 37 km .
between are years 1965 and 1968 be developed in the institute airspace the liftoff meteor-2 , whose initial tests airlines be turkeys in october of 1970 .
the liftoff meteor-2 wasnt a initial weight of 380 ore and was capable of carry a weight useful of 10 ore until 60 km of usa .
subsequently be twentiethcentury the meteor-2h version and meteor-3 .
is necessary mention also the entry of poland in the cospar ( committee plane eea incidence ) in the year 1960 and the training of national committee of cospar two years after .
in the framework of programme interkosmos , poland be joined to the research of space cOsmico about satellite fireworks sadly and , in the year 1978 , the pilot polish miroslaw hermaszewski be became in the secondly intercosmonauta after of vladimIr remek .
the suspension of the law about social jobs not is the solution .
the last week the constitutional trial lifted the law traabajos social .
the resolution adherents a doubtless discussion in the society .
since then will interesting examine the solana ; lithuanias since a point of sight more broader .
are economic systems liberals in the eu , equally that in the world stcentury , be based in the principle of a greater economic competition and least regulation .
in consequence , this means that are different economic forms and are economic national systems are in conflict permanent between yes .
the cause be swing in the principle of free trade and of free movement and unlimited of capital privately , along with the financial speculation unbridled .
the effect of large are differences in the costbenefit labour ( of are wages ) apportionment economic tensions .
under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the that the manufacturer , with the importing of goods cheap , attempts shorten distances and for therefore & quot ; leads a bajadda & quot ; of price of competitor with the objective of shouldnt with the greater part of market and , of this way , increase its margin of profits .
to great scale means , for the majority of are entrepreneurs , xynthia the production at abroad , buy there more cheaper or well disappearing . the outcome is a unemployment high in those countries in are that the price of work , in comparison with other economies , is more high .
due to that the capital privately not has social responsibility any and , with therefore , either is responsible of unemployment that this phenomenon generates , fastestgrowing necessarily the costeffective social of state .
whole this situation evicted the total unwillingness of are entrepreneurs by pay taxes and compensated are economic damage and social that have lessening in its sheer of obtain profits .
the situation is universally so wellknown that not is necessary tabling data statisticians concrete .
are practices little exploit of capital privately create situations , in certain economies , in are that are governments of these countries be supposing forced to compete with the objective of reduce artificially the social Echalon of the own population and , of this way , suck capital abroad at country .
said of negotiator way , are governments gm capital privately to available of its own population without have in account the social decline .
this be ago patent about everything in are changes of are laws observance .
the objective is forcing to the population to that accepted the racists of capital privately , about everything in what that concerned to are wages .
this has place , by a part , through the system of economic obligation in the case of unemployment of long duration ; by negotiator , through the right restricted of are employees in regard to rights labour .
the outcome is a poverty growing along with the increase of are differences between poorest and rich .
since ago a series of years , there in germany points of handing of food for people poorest that not can frontrunners with its own work .
the number of people that receive this type of aid elegant already at half .
in the framework of increase of the competitiveness of the economy german , be apportionment a case quite prevalent : people underpaid with a salary so under that the state must pay the rest for get at minimum tackled for cutthroat .
be cooperative public a scandal of this type ip with the situation of are employees diagnoses of federal parliament crystal .
are measures of shortening of practically all are states of southern of the eu nowhere , without place to doubts , to the same situation . are people , pressured by a decline abismal of its social Echalon , be supposing obliged to decreases as in the century nineteenth or to malvivir with a horrendous salary in the limit of the society , with the expectancy of that some day comes at country capital userside privately .
is necessary preguntrarse of where next ?
in the case of that be treated of others countries of the eu , then the poverty passes of a country to another or not elegant never , since that chinese , indians , brazilian , turks , moroccan , egyptians or africans still working by a tiny part of a salary european .
this also affects to whole america latin .
are theories liberals and are media of communication chances until the indicates that the state not should clarified capital to the economy , that directing the economy leads to its failure .
the capital privately reasoning with tooth and tooth the rapporteur\xe\x\xs of that the state not should intervene in the economy entrometiEndose in the control .
to continuation , is necessary bosnia if the capital privately not prejudice with its selfinterest in the ongoing policy and , by realisation , in everything the state .
in this case the response is clearly definite .
the proof is the existence of lobbies , in the practice very wellestablished and curse , in all are states .
the outcome is a situation desperate that be discontentment in the area of the corruption , in are entertain reciprocal , in a legislation that is practically reprehensible in all parts but not is portrayal .
in germany the situation is the follows : are ministries state , to lack of financial media , employees the drafting of projects of law to legal private businesses , are wish are to often linked with the industry .
this type of projects of law are enter after in the bundestag , the parliament crystal .
of this way , everything the power not emanating of people , perhaps and as be cropping in are constitutions of are western democracies , but of are participant financial groups that represent their own interests .
is timeconsuming that are democracies with a orientation liberal be footing rapidly in a situation how the that describes appiAnos in its resale the crisis of the republic roman in times of caesars and pompeya : & quot ; the directorgeneral state time desintegrAndose and are administrations be highranking to the strength & quot ; .
to change of bribes , entertain expectation ilegItimamente and aid for finance stones or ploughshares .
the admissions and the corruption be swept without unimpeded conceals and the people urumqui to are ballot with the voting apalabrado of sorted & quot ; ... & quot ; not had people with character that aspirara to a since in the administration , so that a once , to cause of this disarray , the state focus eightpoint months without consuls & quot ; ... & quot ; schoolteacher to hears in grave ; of that the single cureall for a situation so severe was the autocracy and that was necessary pick a energetic man & quot ; ... although appiAnos abundantly in pompeya , caesars dEtat at power and taskforce the democracy for always in autocracy .
the conclusion , of same way that in the progressed , is that the current society be based in preferences desconsideradas of benefit individual\xe\x\xs without have in account are common interests .
the capital privately not is capable , in its essence , of understand and demand are profits of whole the society .
the outcome is the same that the of then , a colonised of the elite without unprecedented , without that be investigated a effort for forwards in depth .
are causes of chinas of are regimes fascists and communists must translating , by what therefore , in the liberalization unbridled of are economic systems in the century nineteenth and twentieth .
with respect to the current situation , is possible consider the disappearance of these systems in benefit of a democracy of type liberal , as a incidentally affirmation , to the expects of upcoming coup .
the fact really demoledor is that the current elite ignores by immigrants\xe\x\x are losses of hundreds of thousands in lives , social disasters and catastrophes of are that have been witnessing , so as are crimes against the humanity , perhaps and as are operation in the history ancient and the more recent .
the suspension of the law about public tenders not is the solution ; at least not to long longterm .
under pressure of the economic competition , therefore to international Echalon as within of the eu , the government of the republic czech be justifiable show to continue quest other routes for reduce the social Echalon of the population .
this trend is , by what therefore , systemic .
the solution passes by reforms concrete sociopolIticas , that confidencebuilding therefore the participation of capital of state as the influence of are citizens in the government and that weaken the position of monopoly of capital privately in the society in benefit of state .
israel : the laboratory of chaos .
& quot ; mr\xc\xam\xc\xblzer nothing comes god violence and nothing ever could & quot ; ( not arises nothing of the violence and nothing could do ) , sting in its song fragile and whose refrain proverb & quot ; let & apos ; beyond know not forget how fragile we subjects & quot ; ( not us forget of what fragile that are ) .
& quot ; if my children not case wars , not would no & quot ; gutele schnaper , wife of mayer amschel rothschild , in its bed of death in the year 1849 .
after of the recent droves of violence between israel and the strip of gaza , have arisen , as always , various reactions .
a , of side of israel , riisj\xc\xbrgensen to favour of right of riot and encasilla to are palestinians in the recreational of terrorists . the negotiator supports to are palestinians and lowerranking racism by part of state of israel , genocide perpetrated against arabs palestinians and denigrated to israel of state terrorist .
not want concentrate in whom is guilty of are massacres that be occurring regularly and whom is the victim . at end and at carried , are citizens of today in day of israel , including are territories selfemployed , born within of the situation policy current and not echoes are beginning of the violence .
my intention is offer to are readers a hindsight behind of curtain , a hindsight for compromising whom syrias advantage of are tensions that be unsatisfactory since ago 95 years ( calculated to onwards of the declaration balfour in november of 1917 ) in a small surface of earth of middle half .
some of my considerations be based in historical facts , other in conclusions to are that i reached about the basis of my own way of understand the subject , about whom or why group of people is the subjects main of are events of the history for ; .
in the history of the humanity the history of are struggles by the power is in first front .
in each era can not find a alexander alexander or a countess .
but what that already not is so obvious is if always were these famous are that commensurate their steps of autonomous way or if behind of its heir had someone that orientaba their actions towards a operating objective .
must accept that live in a era that pops the wealth of world in are hands of few disagreement individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this secondreading , not be has able get in a single generation .
of between these families astronOmicamente widening declining a that could considered the more prominent ( if yet there someone behind , not what know , but not what consultation ) : are rothschild .
not be intervening much to pipe of them .
debit .
in are years 90 of century nineteenth compraron the first agency of news ( reuters ) for that organizing of suggestions its behalf with acts criminals of lot seriousness . the power and the wealth , or both , them covered are back , certainty that for them always manifesto a surge .
have cautiously important in almost all are banks plants of world and in those countries in are that not are represented , be has declared or be is prepared a war : before of mp to afghanistan were 7 countries , after of mp of iraq were 5 , after of overthrow to gaddafi only midday four , but meanwhile russia has collapsed the central bank at government russian .
everything who that has tried object to this oneworld has deadlock .
abraham lincolns be refused to renewing the state of central bank extolls an equip of are rothschild , schoolteacher during the war of secesiOn to reprinted money and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre .
jfk started to reprinted money and wanted suspending the system of reserving federal ( edf ) and was murdered in 1963 ; the congressman louis mc fadden was orally the year 1936 after of loved exceeding to the edf by have triggered the great economic crisis of year 1929 .
its sheer by the global power them reappraisal during are years 1859 - 1871 to dividing a plan with three wars attempted , engineered by the masOn ajouter pike , condecorado with the degree 33 .
the first war be marked as objective eliminate are large states monArquicos in whole europe ; the second wanted eliminate the supremacy colonial , especially of great britain , and the third be entirety reduce the population of the earth between half half and billion million of people ( such amount of slave for its wellbeing and luxury voiced and not consumirIan squeezed resources ) , addition of the creation of a religion universal ( the ecumenismo not is nothing more that a preliminary for such solution ) and the definitive adoption of are absolute powers .
the method with the that operates the group of are families more widening , along with are rothschild , continues the dynamic of releasing of crisis and the subsequent send of a solution ( relying ab cao - agenda to onwards of chaos ) .
these solutions are , without however , coffee , and entail always a lawlessness of the situation . if not , enough remember that the edf was finlands for that not be matters a crisis as the of year 1907 .
so that , following the success of assassination of heir at heir austro-hUngaro , francisco archduke , in sarajevo and after of that , to root of therefore , be erupted the first war global , tore the russia inwardlooking with the beginning of the epochal bolshevik .
the first war global ukrainians of degenerative way and institutionally since the point of military sight and economic , the capitulation of germany ( are wars for end with the russia inwardlooking were already continual ) and the subsequent breakup of the great power of central europe , the empire austro-hUngaro .
for floated the ground of the second global war , monopolistic that are bankers and politicians palette , of way bloodless , a situation spectacular to root of are enormous repairs of war ; \ about germany , with what that be fell are conditions optimum for the radicalisation of are mob impoverished . subsequently , them sufficient with latter to are germans the solution of fUhrer , that was what enough stronger and simple and periodical to culprits , and build after a czechoslovakia association by several nationalities with a stronger minority german that prior afforded and confront so well the function of the seventyfive heal , that sheer the called and enquiry the outbreak of the war .
at end of century nineteenth , are rothschild boosted the endowment of movement sionista , a branch that hoped to the training of a state jewish , preferably in the region of the ancient judea with jerusalem as capital ( return at siOn ) .
the declaration balfour referred previously ensured are databases for the immigration mass of jews to palestine and topsecret are first conflicts with the population arab of place .
be assaults attacks terrorists in sides parts .
estallO the second global war : is difficult know if hitler ripcord too of the merry to the that what lucky tapestry are international bankers in a principle or if everything what that cooperative them part of a plan . without however , the suffering of are jews europeans in are camps of concentration set are conditions optimum for the acceptance of state jewish in the global society .
israel was oldest officially in 1948 and , of similar way at way in that are repairs of war ; \ to germany paved the road towards the second global war , with the proclamation of state of israel be set the pocket for a third war .
if are international bankers consiguieran iniciarla , the nation jewish , at equally that in the second global war , be wealth in victim in first online of enlisted , now along with the population arab or , woman\xe\x\xs , muslims of middle half .
israel is a laboratory immense , a machine of soldadura and chaos , not only in the framework of its country , but also to scale international . take as example how be earmarked of way resulted are covenant and advocates of israel .
whom is guilty and whom is the victim in the conflict palestino-israelI ? where the injustice marginalization injustice in a spiral of violence endless , if at beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and its sheer by the global power ?
in this point is necessary distinguish between are inhabitants of israel and their responsibly , because , at equally that occurs in our country , are international bankers only inherently to their candidates in are elections .
the current president of israel b. netanyahu is the typical example of political fascist , embodies to are international bankers , that ago everything what possible for declare the war to iran and , recital that iran is member of the organisation of cooperation of shanghai ( china , india , russia , pakistan ... ) , threaten in become in a global conflict and , if we in account that iran controls the straits of ormuz , by where passes the 20 % of everything the global oil ( the convicts of navigation has only two miles of gauge ) , baltic to the destruction of the global economy .
under why light be show now are succinctly that made david rockefeller in 1994 : & quot ; what single that need is a crisis general and the people included of agreement with a new global agenda . & quot ;
the new global agenda in its imagination is a world of unruly and slave .
a world in the that the rest of the population serves to a handful of people that bedrock part of the financial aristocracy well welloff .
a world in the that to each new humanely be him knockon a chip at unfortunate that controls everything its be .
& quot ; and binds to all , smaller and large , rich and poorest , free and slave , to have a marking in the hand rightwing or in the debit , to not power buy nor sell , to not be that uniforms the behalf of this devour or are figures of its behalf .

film argo : if be crude accords , deluding to hollywood
in november of 1979 a group of the demonstration of students islamists framing the embassy american in teheran and took 52 diplomados as hostages .
its speedy in freedom going to be to change of destronado shah mohammed rEza pAhlevi , the which after of the epochal bakiyev to ee.uu , country that had magnanimity its regime during decades .
for the administration american the situation not defend no perspective positive : bathwater the shah by the thrown not be what chosen allow , since that , if what overdue , disposal in danger the confidence of their allies in others countries .
but the speedy in freedom of are hostages in iran , where the epochal had humanitys in the constitution of theocratic regime , not was to its exerting .
was a coup at prestige of are states united , that subsequently be intensified yet more with the attempt impasse of release to are hostages by the strength .
are diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after of the intervention dispersal of government of algeria .
in ee.uu . , its destination crises a wave of solidarity and illwill against iran .
the failure in iran envoy of decisive way to the defeat of carter carter debit ronald reagan in are presidential elections of 1980 .
the film & quot ; argo & quot ; of director and actor ben affleck tematiza a unsavoury of this history , that cosechO a slight success for america .
little before of lobbyist the embassy , be unrecognized six employees of building .
after of a complicated periplo , sooner in the residence of the embassy coats .
cia , in collaboration with are authorities canadians , achieved extract of iran , for therefore helped a history sly a point extravagante : spared with passports canadians , as member of team eu & xbc ; s that familiarising the tracing in the country for the imagine of a superproducciOn of science fiction .
combination of arts
the plan that bourlanges the expert in & quot ; exfiltraciOn & quot ; toni mendez coordinated the collaboration of hollywood .
for that the silly prompt singles , be wrote about the project eu & xbc ; s in journals specialist , be organised conferences of press , the society of production ficticia wasnt even a clearance real .
are devil about the operation be centralising in secrecy during much time , the film be has fact to onwards of are memories of tony mendez .
the film of affleck is a combination peculiar of several arts .
by a side , a political realistic thriller ; by another , a struck & quot ; caper movie & quot ; , the history of a unsavoury that aired well , a deception ( a example can be the series ocean & apos ; beyond eleven ) .
in the film be combined are states of mood . encountered by a patentable side well khan of teheran . in the sequence of appropriations be aerial show flagship of the era of are events , that were plasmados of same way in the film ; not there many differences to this regard .
by the another , scenes wellknown of hollywood a therefore more livianas , organisms by the irony and a corner exaggeration .
and addition , scenes of the central of the cia and other institutions : men trajeados that analyse the situation in the table of negotiations , in are corridors of the office , by telephone ...
ben affleck has managed defense its career of a way excellent .
the actor , that had been aim of mocked , be has become in a respectable director and its way of act has longer of be the white of comments irOnicos .
argo is its thirdly largometraje , after of & quot ; small goodbye , goodbye & quot ; ( 2007 ) and the thriller & quot ; wealth town . city of thieves & quot ; ( 2010 ) .
at same time , is the first film of affleck in the that the action not has place in the city of boston , where be fattened .
also , the sensitively of everyone\xe\x\xs the atmosphere of place was a feature that footing to are mint of films salute by above of standards of hollywood .
and affleck what shows in argo , where teheran be & quot ; tyre & quot ; in canada .
are best scenes of the film have place in are streets , in the evolve of are events verIdicos . the sequence introductory of the decisionmaking of the embassy is impressive by its capacity sinOptica that , at same time , trasmite the ambivalent of abounds and of the lack of forecast that arises when , in some place , the history gives a later step .
affleck and their sinclaire obtaining a similar effect in are scenes bungled ( the team impostor in the bazaar of teheran ) .
too action in too places
the director took that accept the fact of that a history explained not offers much in the sense eu & xbc ; s of are scenes more schemers .
and be are complicated quite well . to sometimes him adds something to the reality : here not channel everything of way so lobster ( the scene in that threatens the crisis in the airport of teheran , the deviation of a socalled to america and the search unbridled following its floor be verbal in a madness ) .
the weaknesses of argo is the lampedusa that arises of the need of show too action in too places .
alan arkin and john goodman have a role very ridiculous as sinclaire of hollywood , although their famous be deserved more space and not are , nor much least , are champions in this filme .
by these reasons , the film of affleck stays a little of sketch harshest , but is a film that be can continue with a interest moderate , assessing its accede and the lifestyle retro of a thriller that evoke are years 70 .
but that be collapses , why will difficult .
as umpteenth of a history real and as proof of what opposite that can be are notions of omnipresencia and omnisciencia of are services topsecret , is sufficient .
rules for the inflado of skies , bananas and circus
the servant www.bankovnipoplatky.com , that each year presenting a survey about are rates dealers more absurd , now has decided announce the contest about & quot ; the regulation or are ideas more absurd of workshop of the eu & quot ; .
& quot ; be us happened after of finally event , the eu has scheduled approve a quota of 40 by cent of women in posts of direction in large are european businesses & quot ; , mover prAvo eurid nacher , the organizing of the survey .
between are absurdidades nominadas is , by example , the recent decision of european court of unifying are insurance of insurance between men and women .
until now , are women be aventajaban of best prices in are insurance of life because represent objectively a risk retail .
& quot ; other ideas inflicted of workshop of the eu can be proposals by the people until end of this year & quot ; .
the choice noon place to final of month of february of 2013 & quot ; , informed nacher .
between are controversial regulations of the eu is , by example , the nutrients compulsory of biocomponentes at fuel that , as outcome , harms the half environment ; negotiator prohibition is the use of are thermometers of mercury of whole the life only because contain a small amount of a substance fraught or the deign sombre the size of are cages of are hens , that has contributed at considerable increase of price of are eggs this year .
be has criticised the factual prohibition of using the expression & quot ; butter of sandwich & quot ; or the withdrawal of the classical bulb of are victim .
a banana of quality must have a totals of 14 centimetres .
the apparatus of the union decisionmaking this type of decisions to often under the pressure of one or another incompatible lobby or industrial , whose petitions in brussels are ppede normally by some state or group of states ( the republic czech , even with the threat of veto , teaches are demands of their banks ) .
are interests of a lobby were behind of the exhortations , by example , of that are bananas of greater quality crew have in the eu a totals of by what least 14 centimetres and not could tabling & quot ; curvaturas frf & quot ; .
the commission european be stuck saying that with this only search harmonize are national standards not homogeneizadas until the date , that only complicaban its marketing .
are standards that doing reference to fruit and vegetables in the eu , to despite of the opposition of some states , be have relaxation about the basis of that the directive lithuanias twoweek a skills of foodstuffs .
the contender to winning the survey could be the upheld of the prove of year past according the which in are skies inflables that be extends is obligatory themes that are children minors of 8 years not are unlicensed to inflarlos without the supervision of a adult .
the prove overdue reference here to a study american according the which , when be talk of toys , are skies are the main cause of death mortality by mechanical .
also is obeying a similar applicable restriction at use of matasuegras by part of children of until 14 years .
ocurrencias curiosas born even in our country
equally extremes is the regulation corrective to are officials europeans : everything who that vote ; any function official in the eu not can using the designation of macedonias . for not euphemisms the sensitively of greece , be must speak of fyrom ( yugoslav yugoslav yugoslav an macedonias ) .
the servant bankovnIpoplatky.com , in collaboration with the partnership of economists liberals laissez faire , nominO in the survey , between some proposals absurd coms more aforementioned , the upheld of the union about the volume of are provisions of food in the territory of a state member .
the eu anastassopoulos are volumes ceilings of provisions of food that can chilled in the territory of the republic czech the same day of our entry to the eu .
after , the republic czech passed , by example , the volume established for mushrooms in retains , what that him resort a threat of fined substantial .
to are organisers of the survey also them allowance the absurdity of pay to those countries that not conclude access at sea and the idea of empower a subsidy for the request of subsidies .
this class of ideas not arose in brussels but in prague .
& quot ; are in disadvantage by the fact of not have sea .
asked to the union european a compensation & quot ; , declared in autumn of 2004 the then minister of agriculture jaroslav palas ( \xc4\x8cssd ) .
what destabilise with the fact of that in our country be originally much grain and , as consequence of are socalled purchases of intervention , the state wasnt are full stores and be wasnt that export .
according palas , given that the republic czech is far of are ports sea ; , the eu should unless hundreds of million of eur .

are guidelines of are states member are to often white of criticisms , are efforts of the eu in beneath of unhealthy and , also , a functioning and development more tackling in whole the union deserve more well , according several experts , our recognition .
according are experts , the problem more severe is , by example , the tack of subsidies of the eu for projects that not have nothing that unrelated with the sequential of the integration european , but that are states member have managed in are negotiations about budgets .
to are czechs also them subjectmatter the sensitive subjectmatter , of same way that to others countries of the union , the combating by the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products , although our country not always hague emerged trialogue of these pugnas .

the people wants that save the republic , but am a discrepancy , claims okamura
mr senator , how be him happened vetting to are elections for president ?
not be about of be senator or president .
if in our country outside everything well , then not eec my candidacy .
but already not afraid bear unrelated how be monies in are recent twenty years in our country , how are thieves remaining unpunished , be increases are taxes and the age of retirement .
not wasnt ambitions of be political .
when see something that not me likes , attempt give with a solution for change .
and since that already i forty years and my candidacy is independent , the single possibility that i of change are things is pleasure as senator or president .
at senate already has reached , but little after be has since in road towards the presidency .
not is performing the backs to throughout people that what have voted ?
always told that my candidacy to the presidency depended of are results in are elections of senate .
more afternoon precisE that if extractive chosen senator , eec my candidacy to the presidency .
but my objective not is the function ; the function is the tool with the that afraid make reality my own ideas .
by why need the greater possible influence and the mandate more stronger possible .
the problem not is only that let a nation that remembering in the bar or ahead of the television , but that pisoteamos to anyone that stays initiate a change .
to this be him atrisk are media of communication , that fee discredit and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom of stoop .
of me be says that i bribe to journalists or that i been adviser of ji\xc5\x99I paroubek .
going to speak of their ideas .
be presenting to the presidential combating with rapporteur\xe\x\xs financial and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of the property by above of twenty million .
for therefore must change the law .
as president not has this competition and only the senate in its whole can propose laws .
how wants efforts ?
as citizen , i adhoc part of a group of pressure for that the unreliability of guide be pressing as work quasiforms , and what matter .
the problem is in the policy : if someone elegant with a good proposal , already pretty of rightwing or of leftwing , be rejects to purpose and this affects to are citizens .
as contender independent , correspondence of a greater potential for obtain the support of all are parliamentary groups .
without encasillamientos nor dogmas of party , i the capacity of power pick something of each party that pretty better for our country and practice .
be believes more well a man of rightwing or of leftwing ?
since the point of sight czech , i the proreform that the people me believes more of leftwing .
for me not has importance , already pretty a little of leftwing or a little of rightwing .
what that me brushed is that later ethics .
not me brushed if someone is of rightwing or of leftwing , want unite to the people .
always support openly any solution good , irrespective of if the proposal next of ks\xc4\x8cm or of the ods and , of same way , principal in against of are bad ideas .
ago coercion when be says of furthermore . that is demagogical .
but not what is sparingly with what that says ?
when be creates a plan entrepreneurial for the company , viewpoints also certain objectives and ideals .
and intentas acercarte to them .
will those what called populism , but all are proposals of are that relationships already functioning in the world or known experts talk of them .
but without the support of parliament only him remaining fa\xc\xaade .
and with therefore not can cutthroat in the policy to long longterm .
or believes you that if be organization to are people and talk with them , adequately , by example , a responsibility outwith and financial ?
not i negotiator option .
convince to politicians , to journalists and to the society civil and try pathology of my part for ateam .
if outside chosen president , not would problem in organise a europewide in direct by television in the which ask to are leaders of are parliamentary parties that legitimaran the responsibility outwith and financial for politicians , officials , judges and prosecutors of state .
and , eventually , them sooner that communicate basques not what enforce .
if there a hezbollahs stronger that refers are desisting , be can make pressure in the scene policy .
take by case the choice hotline of president , that has been a achievement of the pressure public .
at same time imposed that only am a discrepancy , not am nor a genie nor a intellectual .
for my opinions and ideals attempt seek allies .
spoken of start in the policy and attempt obtain the greater possible support for my programme .
attempt extremes are things later myself same , but in case of that not satisfactory well , within of six years what leave and intend at sector privately .
sounds a little as if okamura outside to save the republic czech .
not am any salvador .
know that with a person not successfully nothing , by why i kilns to a series of personalities counter , by if to what better be animaran to tabling its candidacy at senate .
drafted to unrelated to radim jan\xc4\x8dura , but be refused because wasnt much work .
by my part , by what least i supported to the journalist of research jana lorencovA , that exposed to the light are frauds with oils heavyweights of heating .
me invade plainly of the basis of that the people is really insatisfecha , now am in the equation .
the sixty by cent of the population not total to are ballot and , those that what did , bearing to are representatives of establishment .
in the senate are two of sector independent .
the people elected the senate , of perhaps way that will complicated achieve changes .
without however , myself b\xc\xbge my own ideas , as by example the choice hotline of mayors or of governors .
is recital become its own party ?
yet not what i hardline because not i time for therefore , for check the past unblemished of each one of are potential member of party , nor either i money .
not i money nor for the campaigning to the presidency , in my account transparent only there 20.000 skr .
not has money ?
talk of statements of the property , how is the yours ?
clarification my private property in few 60 million .
in prague i a ground box in 25 million , a exile box ten million , another exile tasado in eightpoint million , a series of works of art with a value of ten million , a aston martin of few 3,5 million and a \xc5\xa0koda superb box in a half , and in the account i a couple of million .
by true , i a aston martin because was my dream of younger . always me amusing james bond , that bergpetr\xc\xbealka this car , was gallant with are women and , at same time , fighting against are maldades and injustices .
leads a aston martin , its property is valued in 60 million and not has money for the campaigning ?
furthermore . says that wants change the republic but not wants put too money of its part .
not is very convincing .
not i 15 million for the campaigning .
i that endeudarme ?
in the campaigning already i since 2,5 million .
the fact of that not vote ; any patrocinador shows that not there too interest in my programme .
and not i the obligation of pay the campaigning with money of my pc .
are expenses of the campaigning employs in essence what that mean in concept of lobbyist of senator .
but not could live of therefore . by example , not could robbing to my son the school familiarise , that costs 30.000 skr usd\xc\xa\xc\xamillion .
if like alone winning money , then not me eec as contender .
so that continue with its entrepreneurial activity for power live ?
not has said before that going to stop this activity ?
this not has nothing that unrelated with a lobbyist greater .
as i pledged , in part i longer my activities .
by example , the representative of my agency of journeys happens to be my substitute in spring .
the people folk that outside the samaritano that salvase the republic .
but myself also need live of something .
looks loosen to winning compiled as employer ?
between 200.000 and 400.000 , that subtle gaining .
if outside president , then discard are turnover .
can consultation whole the interview in the edition of saturday of prAva .
the study of architecture mvrdv shows that are diagnoses adventures not only are in the head - in the example of the library of spijkenisse and the newborn bit & quot ; mountain of books & quot ; - 2 photos
& quot ; believe that the building is fun , has a aspect futurista , and by end there something interesting that unrelated & quot ; , claims lisette verhaig , a passerby that passes by the oneway .
and fUle spermon , technician of you in a great company located pipe of the library , urgency : & quot ; addition , the building is lovely & quot ; .
but myself me wonder for why need a library today in day .
all we internet , tablets and electronic books .
nobody enters by happily in these libraries court\xe\x\xs of fashion , not ?
spijkenisse , a city bedroom located to are doors of axis that barely deserves a fugaz visit , holding the pity honour of cant fixed with a thanked for forget .
the population of 80.000 inhabitants presenting the rate of literacy more lowest of are countries netherlands .
for counterweight this situation so shameful , ago some years be decided contribute of any way to the culture general and copying are sevenyear bridges peopletrafficking that belong represented in are notes of euro in form of miniaturas of poured arm decoradas .
the success of the usher broadbased was finite .
and so was as are responsible politicians keeper that only existed a possibility for improve are statistics : had that build a library !
winy maas , of study of architecture dutch mvrdv , everything a masterstroke in the art of are diagramas of nets and responsible of buildings reallife to the couple that cheapen , be took the subject with its preceding prudently and anwar to the presentation of contest in the year 2003 with five books under the electorates and a smile in the harshest .
and while the jury amazement oswiecim to its around and be encogIa of shoulders , maas romanians to blown are books by size gauge a pyramid and documentation its brief speech with are following succinctly : & quot ; satisfy owe :
here the you , my proposal for the mountain of books of spijkenisse , the socalled `boekenberg & apos ; & quot ; .
nine years after , the mountain of 30 million of eur be worsens in the place scheduled .
ireland ; form part of project of vitalising , that be toptotoe with a park park , a supermarket , a office of emails and a couple of buildings of housing and adosados .
to principles of november the mountain of books was medallists with the secondly prize & quot ; best essex an nl 2012 & quot ; .
addition , the project also is nominado at & quot ; dutch finishing wood award 2012 & quot ; .
of this form , the small city protested of history , that until the date not wasnt nothing more that offer that a zone smartest postmodern and a \xe\x\xfleece\xe\x\x incredibly decrepit following whose facade white one intuirIa more well a central skimmed , account now with a resale of architecture lent .
but about everything , spijkenisse disposal now of firstly building cultural public of its history .
the long road until the book
the first proreform is that be about of a paradise of books under a quesera .
well is true that there a lift that us locomotive fair at centre of this hallands\xc\xasen akaev , but are sufferings peaceloving of space and the reading not what using , but that prefer merged with its topografIa to each step of its escalation to the top .
the internal completely acristalado it adverts and easy of collaborative with the sight , the soil of brick recocido and are elegant farolas support of form unequivocally the precondition public of the library .
the environment urban is perfect .
at raise the sight be can get to brick are banks of threewheel , are dogs and are children and girls playing at football .
and by all sides books , books and more books .
& quot ; normally are shelves of books are willing to what long of the facade and in the centre be opens a huge room darker that , by what general , frequently be something awkward and impersonal & quot ; , claims winy maas .
what that have fact us is put upside aforementioned the classical mechanics esa and extremes the zone of reading of internal at external .
the internal of the mountain is very well tapped : in the half be find are offices , the library of internet , the club of chess , the centre of environmental education and the room of peacekeeping .
noteworthy special deserve are shelves blackest that confined are functions of coating mural , parapeto and barandilla at same time .
the sight , the elegance and the olfato are strangers .
even are saviour and are engineers civilians more at day shake the head when gunfire speak of this material artist .
& quot ; wanted work with materials recycled & quot ; , us explained joop trouborst , head of project in the city of spijkenisse .
and so is as a day , in a agricultural exploitation frisia , us scrum with the byproduct adequate uninterested of the agriculture .
since ago many years , in are greenhouses and in are camps of are countries netherlands be uses a fabric plastic of thin cable of thick as basis for restrain are roots of are crops .
be about of a material cheaper and efficient .
this fabric polluting heavyhanded two satellites and after be disgraceful .
for the library this fabric be prensO , by first once in such quantities , until achieve illustrations of four centimetres of thick .
with the heat and the pressure , the pooled plastic agricultural ( klp ) properly of colour and be becomes in a material montenegrin , homogeneous and durable that chadian to a mixture of new car and zapatilla of sport .
following 105 frontage be elegant to the top of the mountain .
at final of this route continual of almost 500 metres around of the mountain us learn the rewarded : since the cafeteria not only be has a presents sight of the city , but that in she also be can enjoy of pursued tasty croquetas hilversum and their ficus acres in enormous macetas .
these create a environment pleasant to the couple that hushed the moisture suitable air for this mountain of literature .
donations for a new soul
& quot ; although safeguard think brief their large rooms acristaladas , this building is a project exemplary in what that concerned to the ecology & quot ; , refers trouborst .
the heating and the necessary cooling be ignoring to onwards of energy energyproducing .
to despite of that the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of glass , even in are days more soleados the sun only shines during realize hours in its internal .
are enormous cerchas of timber enacted in sense merge to the facade of glass serve for give unreported and absorb the majority of are rays of sun .
this creates a internal confortable climate .
the rest is certainty of are automatic shutters .
fUle spermon , the sceptic worker of sector of are technologies of the information , already be has courage to put the ordinary in the new library .
and lisette verhaig also has state there .
equally , the teacher of traditional medicine china cynthia bogarde has kilns the library . she councils the & quot ; boekenberg & quot ; as the & quot ; soul raises & quot ; of spijkenisse .
the reason is that , with reason of the opening that took place ago a couple of weeks , be invited to all are inhabitants of the city to donate a book of its private series .
of this form be intended fill , of moment , are bits Opticos of a library that yet not account with its immigrants\xe\x\x inquiries ; in the currently has 70.000 copies .
the concept has celebration appreciated .
are shelves are misuse .
& quot ; not there nothing worse that a library half empty & quot ; , claims the architect winy maas .
& quot ; believe that thank to our initiative now all are inhabitants have a true link with this building .
all know that its book form part of the library .
although only actually hence for antifarming .
of this form , the study mvrdv has managed everything a success in that discipline queen that in the jargon specialises be perpetual as & quot ; creation of a identity & quot ; .
the city of spijkenisse has writing a prioritise of the history of the literature .
irrespective of what youngest and inculta that can be .
by end a point of departure for elect its identity .
szabo : & quot ; are germans must play a role more unchanged & quot ;
germany be has abstained in the vote about the admission of palestine .
according pending szabo , expert in are erroneous relations . uu.-europa , this ranked to berlin in a diplomatic position quite thorny .
deutsche rights ; : to principles of week , germany gave to understand that advised in against of the proposal of granted to are territories palestinians the precondition of state observer of are nations un .
without however , finally berlin be conservative .
by why ?
pending szabo : germany not supports what that are israelis have fact in gaza .
now well , due to the special relationship that unite at country with israel , germany must have childcare .
but at same time believe that either agrees the stance american .
germany wanted demonstrate its independence without be too criticism with israel .
during the upheaval that took place in libya in march of 2011 , germany also be conservative when of what that be breadth was of establish a zone of prohibition of flight .
ireland ; has been avowed finally by the nato .
him it difficult to germany adopt a stance clearer when are in game moneyrelated international important ?
yes , so is .
this be must to that in these moment is hindrance its external policy , recede of a policy cctv , by so stick , by are states united and focus in a external policy german .
and what that makes yet more are things is that are europeans not have a policy coherent and uniform .
by what therefore , are germans be find in a crossroad .
of them be expects that playing a recreational more independent , but not are familiar to do .
believe that still are tinker constitutes will its role , but already have initiated the road towards a external policy & quot ; normal & quot ; .
a external similar policy to the countries as france or great britain .
why means specifically a external policy & quot ; normal & quot ; since the point of sight crystal ?
is a policy that , when be about of national interests , be shows unwilling to defend different deliberations to are of states united or their partners europeans .
believe that the external policy german foremost a stronger motivated in the economic policy , is say , in are exports and in their relations with certain regions , as can be russia , china or middle upcoming .
are economic interests germans are until true different point to are of other large powers and by this reason germany must protect their interests .
these economic interests have unforeseen in the stance adopted with regard at conflict in middle upcoming and in the vote of the un ?
by a side , germany account with large markets in middle upcoming , especially in the gulf .
by this reason must be poppy and not alienate of the opinion public arab nor either of are Elite arabs .
this is important , by course .
but myself not him venture discussing importance since that not be about of a relationship totally condone .
without however , yes play a role fundamental in are considerations german .
has undermined germany its relationship with erroneous . erroneous . at abstain of vote in important decisions as in the vote about palestine ?
believe that in europe , and even in states united , the stance german appetite of a huge degree of understanding .
by this reason , not believe that be hague produced a breakdown so drastic as in the case of libya .
perhaps with therefore germany hague achieved inquisitor a true respect .
at end and at carried , everything this not has fact but demonstrate that is a country at that tories in grave ; as international actor and whose interests there that have in account .
in europe there different opinions beliefs of the initiative palestine .
in change , erroneous . erroneous . be has noone clearly to favour of a veto .
there obstructing of opinions between erroneous . erroneous . and many european nations ?
always have fresh these due disparities to the internal policy american .
believe that the government of obama shows in secrecy a great understanding towards the position european .
but , to cause of the situation policy that be lives here , is obvious that the government not can defend in public that stance .
believe that the real obstructing of opinions not has in reality the upsurge that be him attaches .
if looking are relations between obama and the firstly minister israeli netanyahu , see that obama not is for enthusiastic nothing with the policy that develops .
him it difficult to germany reconciling are closer relations that remains with israel and states united , by a side , with the stance of their main partners in the eu , by another ?
believe that is precisely why what that ago that pretty so difficult for are germans .
by course that would a little more easy for are germans if sidelined a policy european coherent and homogeneous , but not is the case .
by what therefore , not have the possibility of become part of a creature higher , but that must endeavouring are things since its own position .
why is precisely what that are doing now with the euro .
believe that in the future germany assume a role of leadership to the time of forcing to europe to adopt a stance european .
by course that this not is easy nothing for germany , already pretty simply by the relationship that remains with israel .
this has been always a subject handles .
but believe that are germans have clear that must play the role of obstructed independent .
be sees germany to same yes in the role of international important actor ? wish in reality a\xc\xaprincipled germany a unchanged role ?
or perhaps him continues offputting difficult accept this leadership ?
germany yet not be has listening , always it something uneasy and , by obvious reasons , at country him continues costing play a role more important .
if saw the crisis of euro , by example , see that each once that germany be insofar as actor main , be mad certain feelings antialemanes .
this not it easy for are germans .
be about of a old problem and is that nobody wants be surrounded of the countries enemies .
seen of this form , germany be foremost in a position much more difficult that states united .
must show a attitude inclusive debit to are different neighbours and opinions and why not it easy .
the influence of erroneous . erroneous . in the policy european decreases each once more , but the eu not awaited of moment this vacuum , whom remaining then ?
to are germans not them guessing more cureall that a\xc\xaprincipled a role more unchanged .
even if not them likes , if them it distasteful or if them becomes in a people yet more unpopular , c & apos ; est the limitations !
pending szabo is director executive of the transatlantic academy in washington , a institution in the that academics and experts in policy from of europe and of america of north analyse of form jointly are challenges to are that be faces the transatlantic community .
szabo is addition member of polls marshall polls , where be has specialises in policy german , external policy american and transatlantic relations .
& quot ; protection of trademarks & quot ; in china : when puma and armani be verbal of suddenly in chinese trademarks
armani is a marking wellknown to global Echalon and melts ralph lauren also .
but , why is armani melts ?
following this behalf be conceals a designation recorded officially in china but that not has nothing that unrelated with are original businesses .
not nevertheless , ireland ; appetite of protection while are sufferings epOnimos not retabled a demand .
and even then not is clear that be them emphasis to give the reason .
& quot ; to are foreigners them it each once more difficult protect their trademarks in china & quot ; , refers thomas pattloch , lawyer of founded taylor wessing specialises in violations of rights of protection in easternmost middle .
each week elegant to my table a new case .
are imitators simply pursued a couple of plate for costeffective power their trademarks .
of this form , gucci be becomes in lu-gucci and in place of prada be uneven prada-kny .
are businesses german also be copied legally of the same way , perhaps and as him has happened at manufacturer of articles sporting puma .
pattloch opens a cupboard in the that acceptability seats of the office of trademarks of beijing .
the 14 of september of 2010 a company china kissinger costeffective the marking zegna df puma , a behalf artificial that also be useless of the home of fashion ermenegildo zegna .
that are chinese are champions attempted in why of copying and of violate are rights of intellectual property is of evident known .
in are large cities there large stores of several plants seagoing exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting .
without however , are cases of pattloch are of negotiator hopes . by bookshop of their customers , him combating against the fact of that the office of trademarks granted of form official to are chinese businesses the right to extremes advantage of a designation that already is recorded in another place .
are chinese what andstates & quot ; bang ming pai & quot ; or marking accompanying .
the prerogative has its origin in the term upshot & quot ; bang dakuan & quot ; ,
that ago reference to women that have & quot ; fish & quot ; to a man rico .
are chinese authorities not be feel culprits
& quot ; is detrimental for the business , there that fight against therefore & quot ; , requires pattloch .
& quot ; the marking ago waters , the monopolistic position disappears and the harm that suffering the image is huge . & quot ;
are financial losses and are procedural shores of are sectors quagmire are grants , about everything in the case of products flagship of luxury .
according data of the company of analysis of market clsa , with a volume of 15.000 million of eur at year china is , in size , the thirdly market of articles of luxury and the that fastestgrowing to greater pace .
without however , achieve the writtenoff of enrolment of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks it complicated and addition supposed much money .
are processes be can prolong until nine years and the outcome is proposal\xe\x\xs .
pattloch talk of cases in are that the court failed a demand because had appropriations therefore time that the behalf aim of the demand already be had become in a & quot ; reality of market & quot ; .
& quot ; if the complainant has etrade fate , perhaps even vote ; that pay money at plagiador because the process has peloponnese to the marking of giving in china & quot ; , refers pattloch .
in occasions this is the law of the jungle .
some of are cases more known have that unrelated with elements grAficos .
in 2009 daimler-benz lost a owed against the manufacturer of machinery of construction sany , the company that has been bridgwater ago little by the manufacturer crystal of bombs of poured putzmeister .
by why to day of today are chinese can continue using a emblem very similar to the notable of mercedes .
the aseans of volvo , geely , used at principle a logo in white and blue that cameras in great measure to bmw ; the subject be dirimiO in are courts and geely took that change .
the manufacturer of clothes lacoste lost in china against imitators from of hong hong and singapore whose logo constitutive a crocodile looking in the direction expertise at original .
are chinese authorities not be feel culprits .
the office of trademarks ctmo in beijing comparatively that in 2010 have had due difficulties to the shortage of electronics and staffing of personal .
the year past , without however , & quot ; the situation of emergency labour returned to the normal & quot ; .
of this form , the amount of processes of filed without furthermore be has reduced in a 22 % .
almost 57.000 of these cases be properly solved , a 75 % more that the previous year .
without however , 81.500 complaints still outstanding of resolution .
fight against this costs much money
as frequently be preceding in china , are figures are shocking .
the year past the ctmo recorded more of 1,4 million of applications of protection of trademarks , almost a third more that in 2010 .
be incredibly of a new thanked and means that china leading by tenth year running the list of new enrolment in everything the world , according refers the office of trademarks .
seems that this also happens with the number of logos valid , figure that eur\xc\xa\xc\xabillion to 5,5 million in total .
in 2011 be met embolsado 1.800 million of cny in concept of rights .
said of negotiator form , this means that of average each alert costs 1.280 cny or 160 eur .
fight against this costs much money , perhaps and as shows the case of the company family german freudenberg .
since ago more of sevenyear years the group contracted in are courts against a imitador upshot .
if well are germans have managed stopping the manufacture illegal of sourced of car of imitation ,
the imitador has achieved check are chinese rights about the marking freudenberg .
& quot ; us ourselves have lessening this situation because in germany are surnames not are protected & quot ; , refers hanno wentzler , president and consejero councils of freudenberg chemical specialities in munich .
the office of trademarks ctmo also failed the resource of are muniqueses .
in are two following forums him have given the reason to freudenberg , but the part contrary continues fronts in the currently .
there that have extremely childcare
now the case has reached to are doors of court higher of justice , where continues overdue of resolution .
wentzler feels in power untangled russias the issue and heralded the professionalising of are courts .
without however , also claims that & quot ; the procedure is extremely costly , therefore in terms of money as of time & quot ; .
it difficult estimate are internal costs ; the entrepreneurial inquiries has had that review dossiers of until sterling years of progressed for power clarified tests .
ago five years freudenberg promised to the part contrary a & quot ; sum of six figures in eur & quot ; with the objective of get to a amicable agreement , but not took success .
& quot ; this shows what much that us brushed & quot ; , refers wentzler .
are dangers that creeping in easternmost middle enforced even with affect to europe ,
specifically if are imitators be assure there are rights about trademarks not logically .
so , a manufacturer upshot lineup costeffective in germany the behalf freudenberg for shoes and products of fur .
ago time that the group chairman this area commercial , not nevertheless crane prevent the alert .
& quot ; there that have extremely childcare & quot ; , claims wentzler .
therefore him as the lawyer pattloch assignment to are businesses german that provided desperately exiting to the time of make turnover with china .
not enough with corporate in the international legislation about rights of marking , but that what that there that make is & quot ; costeffective also in china everything defaults that can be simulation of protection & quot ; , perhaps and as urgency wentzler .
of what opposite , the subject can comparative much more expensive that a simple registration .
of fact , in case of that freudenberg diminish the finally provoked of its particular battle , then would that pay to the part contrary rights of licence by its own behalf , perhaps and as explained wentzler .
why or in the bracket in issue us expulsarIan of market .

this input plug the desist of the school , the uniform and him cooperative a meal hotwater at day in the gogo center .
imbongi means in zulU & quot ; narrador of stories & quot ; or & quot ; panegirista & quot ; .
in this room nobody knows speak with fluidity this language bantU , but lottery yes know .
since ago ten years this chorus trying songs in this dwindling foreign language that in occasions controlling transportarles to its place of origin : the southern of africa .
to 8.733 kilometres of distance in online italys since ag , in the selfgoverning of kingdom of swaziland , there a people struck esitjeni that depends of are voices of this chorus crystal .
the forty by cent is epidemics
approximately 2.000 live people there , some yet in souls chozas of clay and dungeons , a great part of them are children .
more of 300 already not have parents because have succumbed at aids .
esitjeni is a slight example of what that affects to swaziland : the rate of unfolding of aids more fatality and are hopes of life more altitude of everything the world , according unicef .
the population not sees with good eyes the circumcision , a practice that according be has shown reduces to the halved the risk of infection .
more of 40 % of are inhabitants of swaziland are bureaus of fortytwo of the below , and die with something more of thirty years be has become in something preceding .
during a journey whole to africa in the spring of 2005 the chorus found this recOndita population , but what that saw about everything were many children in are streets that condemned not only of the protection of their parents , but of what main : meal , clothes and training .
without title k\xc\xarnten , are possibilities in a country poorest are more that separated .
in a principle was just the particular commitment of few disagreement what that overdue possible that a child outside at college and disfrutara of a meal hotwater at day . everything this by few disagreement eur .
without however , a year after the chorus enacting the partnership & quot ; voices plane condom & quot ; that since then be has occupied professionally of are orphans of aids in esitjeni .
facts about are infections of transmitted sexual
turkeys are are main diseases of transmitted sexual ?
between are incidence of origin bacteriano are the sIfilis , the chlamydia and the gonorrea .
are incidence of origin vIrico more arise are the aids , the fortytwo of papilloma humankind , the herpes genital or the hepatitis .
are ladillas and the sarna be find between are incidence transmitted by parasites .
turkeys are are main groups of quagmire ?
the sIfilis and the gonorrea be give with more frequently in men that hushed sexual relations with others men .
the institute robert koch part of the basis of that at least four of each five cases of sIfilis barred in germany have its origin in a sexual contact between men .
in the case of are adults heterosexuales are diseases of transmitted sexual more arise are are infections by chlamydia , tricomonas , the fortytwo of papilloma humankind , the candidiasis ( hongo ) and the gonorrea .
the infection of hiv between are adults heterosexuales of country is relatively scarce ; not nevertheless , approximately the 20 % of new are infections by hiv be freezing in this group .
between are young , are infections by chlamydia are much more arise that in others groups of population .
according european surveys , three aidshiv of all are infections fails to young of between 15 and 25 years .
in our country , the fortytwo of papilloma humankind also be adds to are diseases more arise between the younger .
how has hispaniola the number of infections ?
not all are diseases of transmitted sexual are subject to declaration compulsory .
according the institute robert koch , the number of infections by sIfilis has doubled its figure of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011 .
the number of new infections by hiv remains a trend downward since 2007 .
in 2011 be condemnation approximately 2.700 cases .
be about of a tenth part least that in the previous year .
why symptom indicating that be about of a disease venErea ?
are infectious diseases can cause Ulceras in the zone genital , bother at orinar , flow , abdominal headache , so as ampollas or verrugas .
to often not cause headache nor provoke others symptom and by why not be alone .
how be can one protect ?
are condom can reduce the risk of infection , but not conjuring protection at sterling by sterling .
some agents pathogens of diseases of transmitted sexual also can conveyed to via of infections by suciedad and by contact formulating .
by this reason , are experts assignment affluent regularly to examinations doctors , about everything if be properly with frequently of sexual partner .
if be diagnosed of form comparatively , the majority of are incidence can cured and is possible avoid any consequence raises .
to via of partnerships , donations and , by finally but not by therefore least important , of are honorary that offered the chorus by their corrective in whole germany , arrive to taxraising quite money .
& quot ; in total have sent already few 200.000 eur to esitjeni & quot ; , refers proud annette lennartz , madam of the partnership .
in the own people zodwa dlamini a woman safe of same yes and with low of leadership administers the money sent since germany .
be breed of that are orphans footing a good cholera , by example with a of are norrland .
are & quot ; gogos & quot ; , as be shape to are women elderly in zulU , are are cornerstones of people .
some of them have until 14 orphans to its office , them conjuring a ceiling where live and be matters of that are children pops to the school all are days evening and orangecoloured with their uniform .
are that not have to nobody remaining under the protection of khanyisile , a woman unmarried that , at equally that are two cocineras that be employees of cook all are days for more of 200 hungry children , ahead a salary of the partnership .
addition , & quot ; voices an condom & quot ; has since in ongoing a school of remnant , has built two gallineros and , in collaboration with the organisation ebb american psi , has achieved that many of are inhabitants of people be have referred to a proof of hiv .
this not is something timeconsuming , since that , to despite of what patent that is this disease in everything the country , not be frequently speak openly of she .
a king with 14 wives
& quot ; the aids is a taboo absolutely & quot ; , claims annette lennartz , & quot ; because has that unrelated with the sexuality & quot ; .
something strange in a country in the that the king has officially 14 wives .
the finally abdicated absolutely of africa black , the king mswati iii , is known by its lifestyle of life lavish and nowadays of oneoff .
poligamia in place of democracy .
this form of life not fiscales officially is in great responsible part of the spam so quicker that has tested the fortytwo of hiv in recent are decades .
but also be must to are countless temporeros that courier the country of a side to another and that what \xce\xd\xce\x\xce\xa\xce\xf beyond where going .
according annette lennartz , & quot ; in any corner be can achieve condom easiest , but these barely be using .
is negotiator culture , here only accepts the contact fur against fur & quot ; .
for encourage the cultural exchanges , the chorus imbongi lightning each two or three years by the southern of africa cantando songs that talk of melancolIa , spirit combativo , expectancy and confidence in the race black , songs that many in the easternmost more southern of continent african yet recollection of the era of apartheid .
a bus karlheinz of whites that swinburne songs in a language of black ; therefore recognition not only acknowledging acknowledging a excellent environment and lot joy , but that also has achieved arrancarle a couple of tears to some that another soldier crossing rabioso .
the journey them leads always to esitjeni , where are singers minieurope to are children apadrinados .
to despite of that this small population barely permeating in are maps , in the valley of rio ezulweni is very wellknown .
& quot ; acErcate to esitjeni , there shines the light & quot ; , claims the people of place .
and following go are 8.733 kilometres in online italys of presumably to ag until are rooms of trial of the oneway bergheimer misuse of singers pointing the step , one be gives account of that also is possible unrelated absent its light since there .

our window at universe : are telescopes more important
seems that the astrophysical was newfangled by hans lipperhey in 1608 , before of that galileo galilei what renewables a year after for abide are stars .
since then , are energyproducing of are telescopes Opticos not has unemployed of grow and are images that us conjuring have each once more depth .
during 30 years , specifically of 1947 to 1975 , the astrophysical hale they in the observatory palomar pipe of san diego was the more largest of world .
its mirror , in the image , wasnt a diameter of five metres .

abiding to therefore , portugal\xe\x\xs a diameter of approximately eleven metres .
the inconvenience of this construction more economic is that the astrophysical has a principle of shrinking fixed , by what that its mobility is threewheel .
the astrophysical hobby-eberly in tejas also has a principle of shrinking fixed .
its manage is its huge capacity for picking light .
to despite of envisage with a diameter of mirror comparatively more slight , such capacity is matched to the of are telescopes of mirror more large of world .
with aid of lofar of arecibo ( harbour rico ) are researchers can auditing the universe in search of signals of life extraterrestre .
the lofar has a diameter of 305 metres .

without however , the information more important of cosmos us elegant of the hand of astrophysical hubble esa .
since the 24 of april of 1990 sending images of worlds hordes .
since march of 2009 the astrophysical esa kepler search galaxies extrasolares , mainly those that are habitables .

a of are functions of this astrophysical will seek the light of are initial stars and galaxies charity following the bang bang .
are researchers ostensibly of the basis of that in the melts southern of mercury also there ice .
without however , not there tests tenable , since that the probe messenger mainstay in around at planet in a orbit much more proximity at north melts .
since ago decades are measurements of radar invite to the existence of ice in mercury .
thank to the probe messenger ( 2004 ) , the first that contradict in around to mercury , now are scientists have the certainty of that is so .

without however , us encountered in the zone more southern of azerbaijaniswedish ; since here the border with iran be foremost to so only few kilometres .
here live are & quot ; talyshi & quot ; , a people of that not be knows much , apart of that corporations perfectly the mouse and the azerI and that are very stalk .
our final destination is lerik .
this small city defeating of a architecture perhaps too maciza sewn in the was soviet and that not seems dovetailed of everything in a landscape akaev so deserving .
are tourists europeans barely arrive to this place , already that the road since the capital of azerbaijaniswedish , baku , it too alpine .
for go are 323 kilometres that reserved both realities urban , be estonia eightpoint hours because the road is of a only sense .
the asombrosa wealth of the that appetite the country thank at oil of sea caspian yet not has reached to this recOndita region .
without however , pilata fatulayeva ( 48 ) is motives of that lerik has what that there that have for become in a attraction tourist .
& quot ; baku be cooperative famous in may with reason of the sahara of kids of eurovision and the upcoming year celebrate the kids of are people more survive of world & quot ; , refers fatulayeva .
be about of the urgency ; of museum of the longevity , perhaps the single that there in the world .
here is indicate the life of eightpoint dozens of talyshis of place that have overcome are 100 years of age . fatulayeva refers a image in white and black .
giving is my grandfathers , that matches 120 years .
a son recognises died to the age of 136 years
without however , the notable incontestable of museum is the baptist of summertime \xc5\x9eirali mUslUmov , that seems have experienced 168 years .
not nevertheless , not there no departure of birth that what certifique .
and if we in account that the man of greater age indicate matches 122 years , seems that the age of mUslUmov is quite alienated .
& quot ; born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973 & quot ; , us explained fatulayeva .
the man focus married in three occasions and took 23 children . at apparently still took time of parliamentarians a daughter more to the age of 136 years .
be has wrong then \xc5\x9eirali mUslUmov in its age in a couple of decades ?
without however , rembrandt fibre , gerontOlogo in the institute charisma planck of rostock , also has heard speak of the older age of this inhabitant of central asia .
& quot ; in some regions of china , japan or in the valley of hunza in pakistan also live people of age very older & quot ; , claims fibre , & quot ; even in sardinia there many men elderly & quot ; .
due to the lack of hypothetical , it impossible clarified scientific tests beliefs of the age ; details when either there any registration civil .
all are days dominate full of butter derretida
is a fact that , of form disconcertingly prevalent , are inhabitants of the region located in around to lerik usually sacrifices a biblical age .
in the currently there 20 people that considerably are 100 years of age .
by why live here , in the southern , many people of age older ?
the guide tourist azerI farid mugimzadeh explained that be about of are genes excise of are talyshis .
the urgency ; of museum , the mrs . fatulayeva , believes in change that the cause lie in the meal .
without however , since a point of nutritional sight , not seems familiar that precisely the meal richer in calories of are talyshi , that assertions the meat , the bread and about everything are products dairy and many of are wish , addition , drink daily a glass of butter derretida , pretty so formulating .
or perhaps pretty the form of natural life the that remains to the people youngest ? in cengemiran , a slight settlement not far of the city of lerik lives rubaba mirzayeva .
to their 97 years is relatively youngest for what that be estila by these latitudes .
mirzayeva , that claims have 143 descendants , lives in a simpler home of timber humbug of whole the region of caucasus .
welloff in the soil , economys of form unstinting a huge tina of butter .
eightpoint live people under a ceiling , between them one of are children and a daughter of mirzayeva , both be separate in grandparents ago time .
also brincan of a side to another two children smaller .
in the cuisine generals tea for are consuls , a tea that serve in few differential dominate with form abombada .
are tooth of mirzayeva are whites and are perfectly premises and under the confusingly conceals two lots trenzas of nose yellow montenegrin that its son us discover proud .
always me i brainwashed the nose with milk , by why never be me has fallen and has backing its colour .
& quot ; either i used never a chemically & quot ; , claims mirzayeva .
the pension is sufficient for live
of always has admittedly just what that originally in its own farm : tomatoes , potatoes and peas .
in whole my life not i gone never to make the communitywide to a supermarket .
then us talk of its husband , that focus in the army .
what worse was the era subsequent to the second global war .
without however , everything returned to its things when the & quot ; wanted father & quot ; , heydar aliyew , took the control of the situation .
this type of propaganda sounds bizarre in mouth of a woman greater .
without however , in azerbaijaniswedish the religion that be pursuing to the obstructed colorado of the nation , that organization its country as a dictator , not perpetual limits .
giving be remained in the power until 2003 , moment in the that commissiondesignate the baton to its son aliev .
at least are people elderly of azerbaijaniswedish not know what that is the poverty .
mirzayeva offered 230 manat ( approximately the same amount in eur ) in concept of pension monthly , a amount with the that be can live well bearing in account the situation here .
and perhaps the canoso son of mirzayeva vote ; reason : & quot ; in our culture are elderly are very physics & quot ; .
live in a great oneworld , are amados , receive all are care necessary and are happy .
as if this not outside reason sufficient for frontrunners with many life years ...
in the constitution lack the expression & quot ; rights human & quot ;
the epochal has circle at cairo .
demonstrations that vying between yes in the cairo gm of highlighted the tremendous division in the that is desperately the country .
the relates constitution , with the sharia as basis , it very recycled .
the president egyptian not indulge in patetismo .
& quot ; must overcome the transition .
and that why occurring is my responsibility , before the people and before god & quot ; , stated in the television public .
its speech going focused to everything the people , about everything to are copts christians , are liberals , are muslims ilustrados and are secular .
all them , cope without cureall until now in a confused opposition , have scared .
scared of a theocracy to shores of kordofan by the grace of the powerful community muslims .
perhaps and as explained jinnah mursi , almost asking assemblies , has had that withdrawn of temporary form are competences of constitutional court and broadening are scuppering & quot ; for power save the epochal & quot ; .
without however , nor are egyptians nor the world whole know very well what that this engineer of 61 years with a title of phd orientates by the university of southern of california wants save really .
intended depriving of its power to the judiciary ?
of fact , are 234 articles , whose approval has been witnesses by a assembly chines association by 100 member predominantly islamists in a meeting nights of 15 hours of duration , are truly worrying .
as in previous constitutions , in the draft also be says that the cater be based in are & quot ; principles of right islamic & quot ; .
without however , why means why of & quot ; principles & quot ; ?
this was and continues open indictors to the interpretation and seems that are islamists going to spheres this vague formulation , so as the margin of legal manoeuvre that leads attached , for impose a interpretation more stringent of the sharia .
this is at least what that implication a new article added : in all are issues relating to the sharia is obligatory consultation to the university al-ashar , the islamic institution more important of country with a great power in everything the islamism sunni .
not has by why be so , but this can legitimate that the clerics controlarIa the legislation , something that - of fact - would as outcome the incapacity of the judiciary .
great part of draft of the constitution is open to the interpretation
what that also it uncharted is that intended maintain the military jurisdiction .
during the dictatorship of alis these fallacious courts for exert a heavyhanded repression about the opposition .
following the flakes of dictator until 11.000 civilians be sick detainees in military alianza .
perhaps and as cast the draft , the state has of protect & quot ; the real essence of the oneworld egyptian & quot ; and & quot ; reckon its morals and their values & quot ; .
be about of a formulation so formulation in legal terms that with the aid of this article are institutions state could even monitor are content of the lawful and the literature .
talking clear not be about of negotiator certainty that of censorship .
by true that any article cast of form explicitly the equality between men and women .
in change another prohibits offend or slandering at prophet jinnah and to their legacies .
without however , not remaining clear why is a offence and how has of be sanctioned .
equally of dubious is the formulation that prohibits the & quot ; offence to are people & quot ;
is sufficient a cartoon of president or a joke about a letrado ?
issue of interpretation , as many other things in the draft that has been submitted to mursi for its signature and that according , their succinctly , & quot ; very soon & quot ; will submitted to are egyptians for be referred to referendum .
& quot ; the epochal has journey & quot ;
ago weeks that the opposition is closing queues debit to the superiority of are islamists .
ten billion people be met in a unusual harmony in the afternoon of friday in the square tahrir of cario and juraron make unstuck the acta before of that can enter in force .
& quot ; the epochal has circle and finished defeating & quot ; , claims hamdin sabbahi , that breed the thirdly place in are lists to are presidential elections .
the nobel of the peace and exdirector of international body of atomic energy , mohammed el-baradei , declared that the draft of the constitution should be & quot ; in the dustbin of the junkfood of the history & quot ; .
to via of twitter unauthorised to are followers of mursi of loved hitherto a & quot ; coup of state against the democracy & quot ; .
& quot ; when nld the referendum predominantly to its palace and what derrocaremos & quot ; , claims the maracaibo jasser said .
& quot ; yet not are tired , the blood of our brotherhood yet not has been expiada & quot ; , be base in are media egyptians at political maracaibo chaled nationwide .
and several judges improvements that not voices monitor the referendum , by what that not be call valid .
& quot ; the koran is our constitution & quot ;
by its part , the community muslims well organised cooperative a appeal for highranking a contramanifestaciOn ; by if developing not in the square tahrir , but following a sentence at another side of kordofan , before the university of the cairo .
many women implies with a sweep and supporters of are salafistas took part in the same at cry of : & quot ; the people requires the application of the law divine & quot ; .
today\xe\x\xs to mursi & quot ; rubbish the country & quot ; , at same time that proclamaban : & quot ; the koran is our constitution & quot ; .
a combating by the sovereignty of the symbolism square tahrir , where started everything , had lessening a similar situation to the of a war civil .
is obvious that are supporters of mursi not wanted significance to that something so drafted .
are brotherhood muslims no\xc\xaone that therefore are that be oppose at draft of the constitution as are supporters of same met expressed their high opinions and clear .
now would reached the moment of stop that the people got in are ballot why direction should continue the country .
in this sense , seems that the draft of are islamists has covering the majority .
& quot ; the expression & apos ; rights human & apos ; nor even permeating & quot ;
hafez mazen saeda is blokland with this constitutional forced process that in reality should have maoists until february and have provoke to all are social forces .
this lawyer of 48 years specialises in rights human and president of the organisation egyptian of human rights ( eohr ) stuck to are brotherhood muslims when be sick internationals in prison or confronted that make debit to a trial during the dictatorship of alis .
not because compartiera its ideology , but because for him are human rights are indivisible .
by this reason was mercilessly , condemned and incarcerated .
& quot ; and now the expression `derechos human & apos ; nor even permeating in the new constitution & quot ; , be regrets in a conversation with the newspaper & quot ; majdanek pan sonntag & quot ; .
the enlargement of are competences of mursi to are three powers of cooperative state that this lawyer be resignara .
are measures actions are gross violations of are rules of democratic game and fruition to egypt to a new dictatorship .
& quot ; in place of strengthen the society civil , what that has fact the president is abolirla & quot ; , be regrets saeda .
without however , the democracy not can functioned without are organisations of the society civil .
saeda be feel abandoned , also by the international community , the which noticeable the combating ideologically that is bearing place to shores of kordofan with a mixture of puberty and tension .
this could backfire in its against .
a manifestante in the square tahrir desirability : & quot ; you concibiendo a devour that not podrEis monitor & quot ; .

& quot ; be eaten crude and then be motherstobe a glass of aquavit of a bitter & quot ; , says havard halvarsen , bombero of the city that is also what that be perpetual as the & quot ; general of rakfisk & quot ; , that be abroad ; of organise the kids .
by all sides see people eating this fish that be acceptability in smaller buckets and coca of a bitter important quantities of the drink .
& quot ; to some people them likes more the aquavit that the rakfisk & quot ; , claims havard .
the drink can aks the smell .
pruebo some masonry .
if yours avoid overlook pipe of the yellow , not is evil ; not is very patients\xe\x\x to a cake of menus that hague few few averroess kilometres in bus .
the rakfisk is a product that comes of a era very different , in the that the poverty azotaba norway and in the that , before of that sidelined the cooling , the fish be bore during the autumn turmoil in water and salt in barrels hermEticos .
more afternoon , in plenary winter , when already is well fermentado , be syrias and , entailed with are senses due inactivos at alcohol , be eaten .
ago so only a generation , thousands of norwegians be saw forced to abandon its country in search of work , and emigrated mainly to states united .
currently , the population is mount rapidly ; more of 13 % are immigrants , attracted by the luckier of posts of work , highest wages and a immigrants\xe\x\x system of social services .
a aware of inhabitants of sweden , the hat contravention and until ago not too much more richer that norway , elegant to this country for work .
the rakfisk be believes important something , a part essential , although quite maloliente , of past of norway .
be foremost between are backfired more actors that be can buy .
but , of fact , everything is expensive . a cane of beer or a sAndwich fee requiring the admired of 10 \xe2\x82\xac ( $ 14 ) each one .
norway not frequently sets in the agenda of day of are international news and to the majority of norwegians them likes that so pretty .
here the people yet is little unwilling to token the behalf of anders breivik , the racist of extreme rightwing that acribillO to disturbance and killed to 77 people , between are that had men , women and children .
in its place , be nos at shootout as & quot ; the inquiry of 22 of july & quot ; .
to are norwegians them costs extremely five\xc\xayears\xe\x\x that in its mild country one of are theirs outside capable of commit perhaps concentrates and murder .
following lot of the current wealth of norway be foremost the growth , since principles of are 70 , of a of are industries of oil and of gas more large of world .
& quot ; but the oil not is the single reason by the that us going so well & quot ; , claims anna , our camarera , while going passes onboard of rakfisk and that , with its long melena blonde and their shocking eyes helmets , represents the image of wellbeing norwegian .
& quot ; are , as say say , people irritating & quot ; .
its english , as the of the majority of people in this country , is impeccable .
& quot ; not us likes alardear , not us likes the paramount & quot ; .
norway has strain its wealth pharmaceuticals with lot warily ; everything , except a slight percentage of money uninterested of this industry , be invests in a special fund in benefit of future are generations .
while everything the world malgastaba money that not wasnt during are years that preceded to the financial crisis in everything the world , norway remained the billetera well doors .
& quot ; while prior wont in winter and make senderismo in summer , are enormously & quot ; , says anna .
& quot ; and feed rakfisk & quot ; , adds with a casual carcajada .
am in the snow doing queuing for feed something ; already i had sufficient rakfisk .
now a clones of alce is without doubt something patients\xe\x\x and quite suculento that savour .
but by the night , again this maloliente fish .
the hotel in the that me alojo is one of are many local in are that be hague a dinner of rakfisk in the that are serendipitous comensales the better fish , or perhaps the that more accords to proof are fallujah nasales .
a television has networked in direct with a presenter that leads pajarita and that is surrounded of backfired of rakfisk .
seems the contest of eurovision .
& quot ; turkeys are briefcases puntuaciones for the better fish there aforementioned in are mountains , thor-juergen ? & quot ;
& quot ; here is our a\xc\xafigureskating , havard . & quot ;
there laughter and applause .
a man be stricken of the wheelchair , perhaps beat by the aquavit .
or perhaps provided are refuelling of everything this fish .

& quot ; shall to propose a new strategy of security that us enable sacrifices this objective & quot ; .
before of minor with the president of are ee.uu . , the experience policy allotted of sr. peNa was as governor of its state tiny , the of mexico .
a state very populated and with a faster growth , that surrounds the capital ; are opinions about the new entourage are widely in this territory in the that him flock stuck .

in nezahualcoyotl , wellknown also as city neza , the contrast with are streets adoquinadas of valley of bravo not could be greater .

while its mother tracing the history , a photograph of noticeable mariana since are mechanically , along to a cross in the that be reads a single prerogative : justice .
without however , why is exactly what that the oneworld says that be him has denied .
& quot ; are authorities of state me have treaty as if outside a hat chismosa , a alborotadora , a quejica .
what that want is that one simply accepted what that them say and that be oneway & quot ; .
& quot ; but why not can be so when have there many irregularities and discussing negligence & quot ; , claims .
the presidential bandwidth that the president peNa grandson eur\xc\xa\xc\xamillion the saturday bulk procession of a huge responsibility .

my crisis of identity mexicano-estadounidense
claims that many be saw forced to abandon due mexico to the lack of opportunities
are mexican frequency to criticise to are that be were ; says that recollection to are mexican of those times match
navarrette observing that are mexicano-estadounidenses be find trapped between two worlds .
in a recent journey to city of mexico , barely had gone by the absurdly and reached to the zone of processing of immigration and already was totally muddled .
few notices yearend the road towards two queues : a for & quot ; mexican & quot ; and negotiator for & quot ; foreigners & quot ; .
me amazed there few seconds without be sure towards where prior go .
at have grown in central california , during whole my life me have struck & quot ; mexican & quot ; .
be about of taquigrafIa cleansing , of same way in that my friends of boston be nos to yes ourselves as & quot ; irish & quot ; or my friends of new york be described to yes ourselves & quot ; italian & quot ; .
more afternoon me chose by & quot ; mexicano-estadounidense & quot ; .
but this was mexico .
and , in the fatherland of my grandfathers , the taquigrafIa or are scenarios not were necessary .
simply was american .
relationships spanish . what enough well as for manejarme during a interview in this language .
but not i the Echalon of vocabulary of a greeks and not afraid deshacerme of my accent american .
so that parliament\xe\x\xs my passport american and me contacted in the queuing of foreigners .
thought in who moment of this week in the that the president servants of mexico , casas peNa grandson , visited the home white for meet with the president obama .
in the agenda of day , as always that be chanting are leaders of these two countries , mccartin : immigration , drugs and trade .
peNa grandson was hearing speak also of growth of the economy mexican , a of are reasons by are that in these moment is so likely that a mexican be please in mexico as that be unwanted to go to are states united .
wants unreliability with states united and canada and create in consortiums a bloc commercial at lifestyle of the union european .
addition , peNa grandson promised continue fighting against are cartels of the drug in mexico , although not gave devil .
for mexico , the relationship with are states united is predicament and is full of grudge .
probably the majority of americans never be remember of that in 1848 are states united corroborated mexico and neglect to their leaders to required the halved of its territory to correcting of correcting .
but for are mexican , that considerably in centuries , not in fiveminute , are elements that be what recollection are by all parts .
so that , in the moment in the that a servant of are states united says any certainty that charter the more minimum criticism to mexico , starter to hear complaints , therefore in the press as between the elite nd , about how are americans are usurpando the sovereignty of their neighbours .
and are children of moctezuma be gm in ordinary of war .
and yet so , for mexico , the relationship that really supposed everything a challenge is the that have with are more of 35 million of mexicano-estadounidenses that live in are states united .
talk of grudge ?
there much .
in mexico there winners and losers , people for are that the country diverse opportunities and other for are that not is so .
the single reason by the that there many people of yugoslavias mexican abject in cities as are angeles , are casino , phoenix , denver or san antonio is that , in some point of our tree genealOgico , tribunal a person , can that the father or the mother or conceals of are grandparents , to the that be him emphasise the door of are opportunities in mexico and took that duke towards the north .
and the majority of are sometimes reorganizing person cumbersome in a profile operating : fur darker , a Echalon of studies under , uninterested of a people poorest , etc .
us are their topdown and them are loyal .
to mexico not .
and , to despite of that perhaps we abject now the dream american , at have gone to neighbourly schools and have had good jobs , not can not lose never of sight that what that are abject is why , the dream american , and not the mexican .
is possible that to sometimes our identity not actually clearer , but our loyalty yes that what is .
is for are states united .
addition , are conscious of that to many of are mexican detain to the elite of the class leading not them gustamos .
the feeling is mutual .
us supposing as a reminder of a defeat humiliating and us starts by above of shoulders as if immovable of a category lower that not is what enough mexican .
our spanish never will what enough healthpromoting and our ties with mexico never will what enough participant .
to its way of unrelated , our existence is synonymous of failure .
if our families not innocents failed in mexico , not be innocents gone .
and now not us effort trapped following this smokescreen of wrap , abject well in are states united but , yet so , as souls solitarias .
my woman , that born in guadalajara and wine legally to are states united when was a girl , me reminds that there this roce between are mexican and are mexicano-estadounidenses because are first know with more greeces govern are and to are seconds this them \xe\x\xder .
although is citizens of are states united , she be believes part of are two countries .
while therefore , many mexicano-estadounidenses that know feel that not are part of none of are two .
us love listen at group mexican are tigers of north , but also to bruce springsteen .
viewpoints what better of each country , but not getting deeprooted to none of them .
in mexico us supposing as americans .
and in are states united be us believes mexican .
now , for overcomplicating yet more are things , by what that me i news during my journey , some leaders mexican and some intellectuals want return to reconnecting with the diaspora .
want that are mexicano-estadounidenses motif as & quot ; ambassadors & quot ; of mexico improvised , turmes their interests in are states united .
\xe\x\xunmanageable\xe\x\x to our colleagues americans what fantastic that is visiting this country and presionarIamos to are leaders politicians for that reforzaran their ties with mexico .
yes , clear ...
why not going to pass .
there too grudge .
and , with the inequality of wages , the endemic corruption and the violence by drugs , many of us not are so insurance of that pretty a fantastic country .
me afraid that pioneering \xe\x\xhungarians to happen concert with this idea , friends .
is fair .
if some mexican yet not are enhancing for eager to are states united by the form in the that protestors to mexico ago a century and half , then have that accept the fact of that some mexicano-estadounidenses yet absolute begrudgers by how be contacted to their relatives ago extremely least time .
hmmm .
perhaps let more & quot ; mexican & quot ; of what that abundantly .
productive battles , new middle half
the high the ceasefire between israel and hamas well could be a basis likely little for the peace
able have some day a peace lasting between arabs and jews in middle half ?
another bloodshed of blood that seems indicate that any expectancy is in vain .
in half of are sustain and arise discussions about whom schoolteacher first , effluent of buildings have stranded accessing to bricks ; more of 140 palestinians , the majority of them civilians , and six israelis have been murdered and , by first once , missiles from of gaza have fallen pipe of aviv aviv , the deservedly of israel , and the city holy of jerusalem .
but , to despite of that are israelis and are palestinians seem be communitybased in its former conflict , everything regard them surrounds in middle half is changing .
the spring arab what has longer everything fact extremity them propriety or not , palestinians and israelis have stranded trapped in the regional mighty .
perhaps this ultimate that its combating pretty yet more bloodiest that before .
without however , there reasons for thinking that its antihuman situation of point deadlock could desencallarse .
a war that nor be stays nor be earns
to first sight , the optimism seems currently very difficult of justify .
even if be remains the high the ceasefire agreed the 21 of november , are clashes of this week have reinforced to are hawks of both sides .
are leaders of hamas , the movement islamist that has ruled gaza since 2007 , contend have justifiable to are israelis to withdrawing , to despite of that gaza has received a good fossils .
and to despite of have fattened to some of their leaders and ran to pressure to are 1,7 million of inhabitants of gaza in one of are corners more squalid and middlesized of planet , israel not has able end with hamas .
of fact , hamas is gaining ground in west , the negotiator part of palestine currently centreright by their implacable rival of fatah , the facciOn palestine more moderate .
addition , are leaders of hamas could get to the conclusion of that the unstable time to its favour .
given that are islamists have gone gaining influence by everything the world arab , hamas has fact opportunities widening and powerful .
turkey , a renaciente regional power that previously had been the organisation\xe\x\xs muslim more practicable to israel , has espoused the cause of hamas . also what has fact qatar , one of are states more rich and dynamic of gulf .
are exultantes member of hamas say that the average moon islamist is bishops israel , since the lebanon at north , where predominates the partido-milicia hizbulA , passes by syria , where are rebels of a trend each once more islamist could overthrow to abdullah assad , until get to jordan , where are allies of hamas are threatening at king .
about everything in the flank southern of israel , the growth of are brotherhood muslims targeted by the president muhammad morsi in egypt , with difference the more populated and fundamental of are countries arabs , has reshaped the balance of the region .
hosni alis , the despot secular that revitalised in egypt during 30 years until its nemeses in 2011 , not took too time for hamas .
in change , are brotherhood muslims are primos brotherhood of hamas and their leaders depend more of the opinion popular .
in future actions outrages , is possible that hamas legitimation as unchanged at that not be can exclude , nor even israel and are states united .
while therefore , the wings heavyhanded of israel find the conclusion contrary .
in what that be concerns the military issue , have since to hamas in its website .
the ballistic system cUpula of iron of israel has shown its efficiency and many of are missiles of hamas have been destroyed .
are israelis dormirAn more dreaded ... during some time .
in regard to the diplomacy , states united be shows more firm that never ; many countries europeans also culparon to hamas of have initiated the latest wave of violence .
before everything , israel has prosperous . especially under the government of benjamin netanyahu , a firstly minister that has ignoring widely the process of peace .
although are rockets abbass since gaza have host with the life of few 30 israelis since 2004 , israel not has had too terrorists bombers , in part thank to the barrier that corrodes west , the main prioritise of a territory oars to become in state of palestine , and protects are settlements jews that still mount to despite of that , according the international legislation , provided illegal .
the sr. netanyahu , whose party likud be has uk to a group of a online yet more heavyhanded led by avigdor lieberman in the period runup to are elections the 22 of january , is in a good position .
by why mimar to these retorcidos palestinians thanking a state own ?
if really gobernaran in west , not dispararIan rockets perhaps and as have fact its compatriots in gaza ?
is better taken following this wall and give a good coup if rose the head .
perhaps be endeavour the wings heavyhanded , although the spring arab could interruptions their somewhere .
although are islamists that enterprises the power in egypt and in others websites not conclude too aloft to israel , its priority will tackle are internal difficulties .
the budget of defence of israel is greater that the of their four neighbours arabs together .
initiate a war with the superpower of the zone citing indiapakistan to are new governments arabs to improve their economies .
that the pragmatic sr. morsi hague worked with obamas obama for achieve the high the ceasefire is a good bodes and could adhered the beginning of something .
also are israelis should thinking to long longterm .
with the rest of world arab inventive more democratic , depriving to are palestinians of its right to the selfdetermination supposed create a erupt that a day explotarA in are territories occupied by israel , of the same form that this week exploded a bus in aviv aviv .
the repression already is competitivity the democracy in the state jewish and the demography graver the situation to measure that casualty the population arab .
are cruentas missions against gaza each two or three years for reject to hamas salaries a toll seriousness each once greater .
both sides estonia a push of foreign people at conflict .
the solution continues remains the that pregonan sensible people of both sides , the majority of external world and this newspaper : two states and the vested of territory by part of israel by reasons of security .
the expectancy , small to shortterm longterm , is that the high the ceasefire advise a little more of impetus to are foreign people that are fighting by this cause .
egypt , that must start to put curb to the entry of weapons in gaza , along with turkey and qatar , be foremost in a situation without unprecedented for convince to hamas of that accepted the idea of a state jewish based in are borders of 1967 , with removing of earth and a jerusalem shared .
are arabs misinformation at subject also should pressure to hamas and fatah for that be join .
why compliance more to the creation of a state palestinian that the \xc\xabn attempt of obtain a category of state cyberspace in the un .
the sr. obama also has a important role in what that concerned to achieve carry to israel to the table of negotiation .
during its firstly mandate tailing tabling its own plan for the peace .
of new in the home white , seems equally of reticent to fact its attention .
this attitude supposed a microcredit vision of future .
a middle half stable is of vital interest for are states united .
this secondreading a agreement of peace between israel and palestine .

in a world constantly networked , not is so evil dull a little
during are greetings of day of action of thank of this year , of form unexpected had that pass five hours in a airport because the aeroplane in the that volAbamos suffered a problem electronics and had that wait to that equities another aeroplane .
so that had extremely time for thinking in the boredom .
not pioneering shall to stoop .
pasarse half day in a airport waiting to that comes a flight is quite boring , even if viewpoints media for be dawdled , as books , journals or iphones , without forget of are duty-free tents .
but each once there more academics and experts in development mortality that praising are blessings of boredom .
according them , is well that , therefore us as our children , us aburramos of once in when .
dull binds at brain to seek options interesting and can that emphasizing the creativity .
given that , currently , the majority of us are connected to this or to reorganizing screen , not moments are profits that contributing the boredom .
so that , should accept of good mood the boredom ?
yes .
and not .
but , already discuss of therefore more later .
in firstly place , at equally that lot people , supposed that , now that addressing of more time for the leisure , the boredom would a phenomenon relatively recent .
but , perhaps and as claims peter toohey , astonished of history greek and roman of the university of calgary , in canada , and author of book & quot ; boredom : to lively clive & quot ; ( & quot ; the boredom , a history obliged & quot ; ) published in 2011 by yale impress basque , not is so .
& quot ; of fact , the history of boredom is very exhaustive & quot ; , claims .
in are walls of pompeya there graffitis in bono about the boredom that bc of century identified d.c .
also must consider how define the boredom .
& quot ; the problem is that already be has defined and discussed of very various shapes & quot ; , acceptability john d. eastwood , professor of psicologIa of the university of york in ontario , canada .
following examine are investigations constantly and avenues the idea before a group of discussion adhoc by 100 people , the professor eastwood and their colleagues advancing the boredom as the experience of & quot ; desired , but not power , participate in a activity that fee full & quot ; .
claims that the difference between the boredom and the apathy is that the person not ago something but wants do .
refers that with the apathy not there the desire of make something .
the experience main of boredom , claims , is & quot ; the breakdown of process of attention , aches to a under state of mood and to a feeling of that the time passes closeness & quot ; .
the boredom can sounded indignant reappear to the depression .
without however , the professor eastwood says that , although able be asserting , are people that are aburridas frequency to unrelated the problem as a issue of environment or of world , while that are people that are deprimidas feel that the problem what have them .
to sometimes believe that are boring , when what that us occurs in reality is that we problems for concentrating .
in its study & quot ; wealth unengaged mind : defining boredom onsite terms an attention & quot ; , published in the edition of september of the magazine perspectives connected psychological bamst , the professor eastwood and their colleagues be eurojust ; to a previous experiment in the that are participants escuchaban a sixyearold of a person that weilers the article of a magazine .
some groups gunfire in the room contigua a programme of television to everything volume that not bore no relationship , others what gunfire with the volume under , of way that barely was nationalistic , while that the thirdly group not listened the audio in any moment .
the group that listened the programme with the volume under reversed more boredom that are others two groups ; them spanned patently , but not were insurance of by why and what inflow at boredom .
& quot ; when intentas concentrarte in a task difficult or interesting , the breakdown of the attention can carry at boredom & quot ; , indicated mark j. fenske , professor of neurociencia of the university of guelph , in ontario , and one of are originators of study .
& quot ; by another side , when getting doing something boring , as undetectable sourced environment ; in a online of manufacture , a music that fee distraiga fee can help to not aburrirte & quot ; .
& quot ; of fact , currently know that stuck or make garabatos , actions that to often be contravene as heralded of boredom , can in reality help to combated , already that doing that that person actually reestablishing more vigilant & quot ; .
& quot ; are investigations demonstrate that those children to are that be them allows stuck learn more and forged more information that those to are that be them binds to be static ; & quot ; , claims the professor fenske .
all know what that is dull in some moment : the delay of a aeroplane , a speaker monOtono , a film especially aburrida .
but some people have more trend to dull that other .
for help to medirlo , some researchers proceeded in are years 80 a & quot ; scale of trend at boredom & quot ; .
the scale includes issues as & quot ; many of are things that i that make are endlessly and monOtonas & quot ; and & quot ; there many things that me eulevel that not i time of do everything & quot ; .
pending vodanovich , professor of psicologIa of the university of snails florida , claims that , using councils levels , are researchers have discovered that are nauseating have more trend to dull more to often that are weightcontrol , and specifically estonia more stipulation roadmap and more diverse .
but , in general , are adolescents are a type of group that be boring with quite easily .
in 1991 , reed larson , professor of development humankind and img of the university of illinois , reappraisal to carried a experiment in the that be disposal in contact with 400 adolescents and with their parents between sevenyear and eightpoint sometimes at day through a search .
found that the 32 by cent of are adolescents starve that be aburrIa while was in the school or doing are homework , while that the 23 by cent starve that be aburrIa when not was in the school .
by another side , the 3 by cent of are parents saying that be aburrIan .
the professor larson said that not knew if are percentages of current boredom , 21 years after , would middlemanagement or upper .
but said that what that yes knew was that & quot ; the adolescence is a period in the that the boredom portugal\xe\x\xs its correctness more highest & quot ; , in great due part to that therefore to are children as to are adolescents not be them gives a great control about what that want make .
so that , leave to my question of principle : is healthpromoting dull ?
to sometimes not what is , already that , fight at easternmost , can make that us negligence to physical unproductive risks , as make casino or selfexplanatory in the consumption of substances as method for combated , perhaps and as demonstrate are investigations .
by another side , many philosophers and writers talk of the connection between the boredom and the creativity , according claims the professor vodanovich , that has state departments this issue during more of two decades .
& quot ; the boredom is the way that has the brain of advice that take be doing negotiator certainty & quot ; , says garry marcus , professor of psicologIa of the university of new york .
but the brain not always knows why is what more indispensible .
if getting boring and colourful that energy for touch the guitarra or cook , why fee corrie .
but if categorized the television , is possible that fee addresses to shortterm longterm , but not to long longterm .
& quot ; so that , if hostagetaking son is boring and him feed a ipad , is possible that already not be aburra , but not will learnt to sanitary by same yes or to dosificarse & quot ; , claims the professor fenske .
and & quot ; that capacity of dosificarse be applies to other situations & quot ; , refers .
hostagetaking son not only afterwards to sanitary by yes only , but that afterwards to supervised better in other fields .
not believe that really reinforce impressed the boredom .
but either should be too critics with him .
our objective should be , more well , the of comfortable satisfaction seq of rumour everwidening of are activities and are technologies .
the professor eastwood is of agreement .
& quot ; to our way of unrelated , need aburrirnos more , but the boredom is a desire too olympia and disturbing as for dedicated with something that deserves the penalty & quot ; , claims .
refers that what that the people really search is a way of disconnect and of enjoy of a time deadlock .
& quot ; in a environment in the that are constantly sobreestimulados & quot ; , claims , & quot ; is difficult find forms of spotlight our attention when the fuss disregarding & quot ; .
colorado : without book of instructions for the new law about the consumption of marijuana
anthony orozco , student of 19 years in a institute img and exalting of southeast of colorado , be faces to a process outwith by something that soon will legal in everything the state : the possession of pursued stones of marijuana and a pipa that used for fumarla .
orozco says that a day of september , him and some friends billboards by lamar , in are plains registrars to the border of kansas , when are stop the police .
the police found marijuana in the car and a time after orozco received a induced judiciary by possession of drugs and articles asserting ( crimes minors that entail each one a fined of 100 dollars americans ) in the that be him \xe\x\xit of the date of trial .
& quot ; us trying as to criminals & quot ; , says orozco .
and what are ?
in are weeks of uncertainty following to the vote that took place in colorado for the legalising of the tenure of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use , the response in hundreds of causes minors by tenure of drugs depends least of the law that of the enterprise\xe\x\xs .
hundreds of crimes minors by possession of marijuana be are overwritten therefore here as in the state of washington , where be adopted a similar measure .
are departments of police have longer of tabling charges against are elderly of 21 years by possession to small scale , that be assure legally a once the law hague enters in force in are forthcoming weeks .
but are prosecutors of districts more conservatives of colorado be have committed to continue later with are open cases by possession of marijuana and still are statement to people .
at same time , several cities , since are suburbs of denver until are western mountains , are voting for prevent that be contact tents of marijuana , approves recently , in their communities .
& quot ; everything this is changing so rapidly that not know why will what follows & quot ; , said daniel j. oates , head of police in aurora , fair at this of denver .
those be employees of are unhealthy in the state of washington also are dwelling dwelling at subject .
and still quest advice for establish a system of licensing of production , manufacture , distribution and sale ; everything therefore before of that comes the date limit , the 1 of december of 2013 .
say that , for well or for evil , colorado going by ahead of the majority of are states in regard to the strides of use of the marijuana , first with purposes terapeUticos and now for recreational use .
& quot ; colorado disposal of a market more regulated , so that will a good guide & quot ; , claims brian e. smith , spokesman of the commission of control of alcohol of state of washington .
but the sr. smith derogations that any place or system only can make suggestions about what that could functioned .
& quot ; not there a lipservice precedent that us serve of model & quot ; , claims .
the law of washington , socalled i-502 , enters in force the 6 of december , what that leaves also a year during the which be nadarA between two waters , already that the system of licensing in this state yet not willingness , but the possession will legal .
addition , there some mechanical issues trickier that must disputes during this period , as the way of maintain a balance between the reexamined of state of offer a & quot ; access adequate & quot ; to the marijuana authoritative and its prohibition of make turnover of cannabis in a radius lower to 300 metres of schools , parks , areas of game childrens or centres childrens .
& quot ; in any place publics more difficult heysel a business of cannabis solomon that in are areas urban , especially in the area heavy of seattle & quot ; , says ben livingston , spokesman of centre for the legal cannabis , a group of research caucus recently .
the 21 of november , oates , the head of police of aurora , sent a email ecommerce to their agents of police in the that them \xe\x\xit of that the prosecutor of the city discard of prevail judicial actions by untruths convict by possession of marijuana to people elderly of 21 years and of that the police discard of tabling charges against these crimes & quot ; with immediate effect & quot ; .
the head of police oates said that them be away of make comply the regulation of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana with purposes therapeutically and that relocate persecute to traffickers and sellers of drug .
in the county of weld , in the north of colorado , the prosecutor of district , esteem buck , represents a vision more stringent .
following the vote , assured that its office annihilation persecute are cases of possession of marijuana , mainly for pressure to are consumers and that be operations to receiving treatment .
currently , 119 people be face to charges by possession of 56 grams or least of marijuana , although many of them have others charges .
& quot ; our office has the obligation of prevail judicial actions against throughout untruths that in the moment in that be were were crime & quot ; , said the sr. buck in a declaration .
the response has been predicament even in places as the rural county of table , where are voters rejected the initiative about the legalising of the marijuana .
the police of finishing junction , the greater city of county , already not quotation to adults by possession of small quantities .
pete hautzinger , prosecutor of district of county , supported this decision , but also decided not underestimating none of are outstanding cases by possession .
& quot ; not believe that actually losing the time at continue doing comply the law until that ireland ; changes & quot ; , stated .
to despite of that the 55 by cent of are voters supported the measure , never be seen that carry the consumption of marijuana for recreational use at likud of government and of system judiciary outside to be easy .
are reactions odds that arise by everything the state gm of highlighted a transportation ambivalence between are officials regard of great experiment dumont in this state .
& quot ; be about of a cultural barrier with are prosecutors of district & quot ; , claims provided mcallister , a lawyer of denver that represents to are accused by possession of marijuana and that is local spokesman of the national organisation for the reform of the law about the marijuana .
& quot ; have past therefore time cooperating to people before are courts that , in reality , still not can accept that pretty legal & quot ; , stated .
at be are first states that feel are small quantities of marijuana of the same way that if outside alcohol , colorado and washington be generals for become in are cases of proof to national Echalon in regard to the legalising of drugs .
while lawyers and officials of state delegates with a new border of legal sales , also awaiting eagerly receiving complied of federal government , that yet envisages the consideration of the sale and the cultivation of marijuana as crimes umbrella .
are defenders of the legalising of the marijuana have the expectancy of that the department of justice exerted .
to despite of that be have produced some lips arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for purposes therapeutically , the federal government has permitted in its majority that maybe turnover of sale of marijuana with these purposes in colorado , washington and 16 states more .
& quot ; although is likely that are agents integrates not tiren doors obstacle for confiscate a bag of small drug , probably be leadership covertly to allow the functioning of tents regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use , seals in the new law & quot ; , said kevin a. sabet , a exasesor of policy integrates of the administration of obama .
several cities of colorado not awaiting to that act are authorities umbrella .
even before of day of are elections , some local governments sanctioned moratorias about any new shop of marijuana , to despite of that happens around of a year before of that anyone of them can fullscale .
the last week , the city western of montrose adopted a prohibition of six months and is likely that the approved the week that next .
& quot ; not want put in a situation in the that liking to someone and then wwwstopeuropeanoverregulationeu a severe problem to federal Echalon & quot ; , mover bob nicholson , member of \xe\x\xfleece\xe\x\x .
& quot ; our community voted in against of this amendment .
are departments to favour of what that voted the community debit to vote to favour of what that voted the state . & quot ;
many arise questions at regard .

singapore search payers for save the economy
are singapurenses blamed to the career , the civilisationrelated and the eurozone of are properties and the education by not have children .
& quot ; the population of singapore needs grow & quot ; .
am a husband patriOtico , replied my wife patriOtica , expect with our duty ods and believe life !
can apparently improbable that these ezra provided part of a oneminute of originated of menta , but to despite of why - or perhaps due to why - the webstreaming be returned viral in gUnther in singapore to principles of this year .
are quoting are part of a rap that uses local references as & quot ; going to put a bao ( bollo ) in the oven & quot ; for laughing of the rate of birth of singapore .
the company of advertising that cooperative the webstreaming , bbh , participating the expectancy of that with the oneminute twostate draw the attention about the problem of a way amusing .
its creative director , douglas hamilton , says that consequently wielding the power of the music for that the people observance with & quot ; its national duty & quot ; .
this is something purely of internet , so that had that do fun and ridiculous .
is the greater problem in this country .
are are worst of world in reproducirnos to us ourselves , so that verge that this was a subject that vindicated that tackle .
knew that the government had tried many things , as launch perfumes with feromonas or organise veladas of quotations quick ( speed-dating ) .
many of these ideas can have been creative , but not necessarily polling .
so that stick , by why not doing what more creative possible for environments this problem , that is remind a rap ?
1,2 children
the that not be what decisionmaking so to the lightly is the government of singapore .
guardia us $ 1.300 at year in policies for encourage to are citizens to have more children .
a package of government for peopletrafficking and parents conferred until 15.000 dollars by child , stretches are licensing by maternity and diagnosed profits prosecutors .
but everything this has had little effect .
singapore is a city state richer and of fatality technology in the southeast of asia , also wellknown by the conservatism of their rulers and their stave social controls .
the rate of birth of singapore , of agreement with its national division of population , be ranked currently in 1,2 children by woman .
the latest once that focus by above of 2 -conocida as rate of reposiciOn- was in 1976 .
so that by why are singapurenses not have more children ?
so jingsheng ming , urgency ; of policies of marriage and oneworld of the national division of population , says that is due to a & quot ; better education & quot ; and & quot ; a range more wider of opportunities of career & quot ; .
& quot ; why him has permitted to the people truly of a range more wider of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities , more beyond of intrigued and become a oneworld & quot ; , explained .
these changes in are social standards have contributed at increase of the solterIa , and to deploying the marriage and are challenged , what that gives as outcome a drop of the rate of birth in singapore .
while therefore , a policy of immigration eu correcting to increase drastically the immigration for reacting debit to the drop of the population has caucus umbrage between the local population .
in singapore there websites website where rife the xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants , in particular are chinese , to are that criticised by maintain are wages netherlands and not integrated .
the increase of the immigration also is seen as a of are reasons by are that the year past the party of government of singapore underwent its worse electoral outcome since the independence .
since are elections has there a attempt of correct the problem , with are quotas and taxes more highest for are workers foreigners .
consequences unexpected
while that the nemeses in the rate of birth has effects known in the economic growth of a nation , are income prosecutors , are costs health and are policies of immigration , the example of singapore also is bearing some consequences unexpected .
the government attempts that not be motorways many small houses .
by example , has started to affect at sector timeshare .
the authority of development urban has past to monitor the number of apartments smaller , known as & quot ; box of shoes & quot ; , that be able build in certain areas of the city .
these apartments have rooms of 46 square metres and have had much success of sales .
without however , there concern of that able reckon a lifestyle of life of solterIa and desanimen to are developers that organize build large houses , relatives .
but lim yew chee , general director of the company belgians the developers , says that their & quot ; boxes of shoes & quot ; be dumped much more faster that are units more large .
are more popular , in the sense of that are units be deplete days , even weeks , more faster that are units of greater size .
this ago that pretty much better for our flow of box .
without however , derogations that are new standards give chairpersons more unclear for are developers , to are that before be them disposal snags if wanted offer busy small units in a project .
too estresados
singapore is a city state .
if well these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the rate of birth national , at speak with are singapurenses that working in the financial district of centre prompt that not going to have much effect .
& quot ; the people is very estresada , are houses are coin and also what is the education , by what that many people what are postponing & quot ; , says a youngest executive .
other people can have children .
& quot ; but for me is important envisage with my own money and time & quot ; , says another youngest of few 20 years .
men and women gs its career , the civilisationrelated and the eurozone of are properties and of the education as are reasons that them prevent have children .
so that , by much that the government treated of oppress to their citizens to have children , when be about of make payers , are singapurenses are those have the latest prerogative .

& quot ; suramErica must learn of europe for integrating a citizenship & quot ; : raphael correas
the president of correas , raphael correas , stated today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in the that & quot ; suramErica , in this case yes , must learn of europe & quot ; .
correas , that took in the saw presidential summit of the union of nations suramericanas ( unasur ) , aired in lima , declared to the statebased broadcasters peru that are europeans & quot ; be sabena in the second global war & quot ; and in others conflicts , & quot ; but now are practically a fatherland & quot ; .

& quot ; there that achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers by any country suramericano , as already happens with are agreed of the community andean , but still there sectors bandar that us want back at past & quot ; , warned .
the president betancourt be reversed , addition , to favour of the euroinfocentres of the organisation of states americans ( oea ) under the premise of overproduction the influence of are states anglosaxon and have in account to are that have cosignatories the pacts of san josE about are human rights .
are that give womans never be committing to nothing and , in change , us are suramericanos what attendance everything .
& quot ; is incomprehensible that the commission interamerican of human rights actually in washington under the funding of states united & quot ; , stated in box at political asylum given by correas at founder of wikileaks , julian assange .
correas assured that not is arrepentido of that decision because with therefore not has betrayed their principles , but that has disregarded their & quot ; profound values corresponding and of human rights & quot ; .
levelled that , in its moment , & quot ; had suspicions degrading of that assange outside extradited to a thirdly country and not be respect its process & quot ; .

us not concessions with human rights , that prerogative not the therapeutically in this case , but has there settingup talks .
& quot ; the solution of this problem is in hands of great britain , sweden and of are legal european authorities because the lawyer of assange , baltazar baltasar , is doing a series of procedures in different european forums & quot ; , professor .
and opinion that & quot ; if great britain gives morning the convince this be just & quot ; .
and if sweden , as perfectly what allows its legislation and as has fact in others cases , interroga at mr assange in the embassy of correas in london or what interroga fasttrack skype morning same be just this problem .
correas occasion for assert as a proponent of the freedom of press and matizO that what that not crumbling is & quot ; the mediocrity , the etrade faith and the silly , that weaken the freedom of expression & quot ; .
& quot ; are elderly enemies of the freedom of press not are are politicians villains and grievously but are bad journalists in function of appetites , the ransom and the extortion & quot ; , said .
in this aspect be welcomed that already not provided these journalists & quot ; nor are bankers nor are hegemonic countries and burgueses are that corporations to correas & quot ; , and anticipated that of be reappointed & quot ; requests in the epochal for continue the road and the direction accurate & quot ; .
correas also supported the decision of maintain the veto to paraguay in the unasur at least until their forthcoming elections , at continuously that the body & quot ; must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the golpismo fraught of legality & quot ; because in reality & quot ; catastrophe the legitimacy of the democracy paraguaya & quot ; .
the president betancourt seen , addition , & quot ; perfectly irrelevant & quot ; the desire of its counterpart colombian , juan manuel ends , of particulars now with nicaragua are limits sea ; between both countries following the ruling of the accountable international of justice of the hague , that sucrose to the sovereignty maritime nicaragUense .
by the moment not be playing this ruling .
is a problem between a country facilitates and one centroamericano .
are conflicts are inevitable , but must be overcome by the goodwill of threw together .
there that enables of form wider for overcome and continue later .
also wellbalanced in a good conclusion of kargil by limits sea ; that hushed in the same court peru and chile and opinion that & quot ; is adjudicate for america latin seek international forums if are two countries be committing to accept ruling by hard that pretty & quot ; .
in reference to the eventuality that be present as contender in are forthcoming presidential elections in correas for seek a thirdly mandate running migrant that sees that possibility & quot ; with much optimism and joy , although to sometimes is quite hard & quot ; .
correas assured that if stays are decades ; of february of 2013 be withdrawn of the life public .
in what personal never me has interested the power , but in situations so unjust as the of correas that socioeconomic poverty only be can correct since the political power .
& quot ; my movement pOlitico costfree that was myself anyone defaults that likely victory , therefore we that accept that reponsabilidad & quot ; , said .
of winning would my finally period in the presidency and of hence scrum of the life public .
if lose equally .
& quot ; is a decision & quot ; , stated .
correas be leadingedge also at new treatment of health of president venezolano chAvezs chAvez in cuba .

& quot ; was as if me liked a averting & quot ; , concerns at milestones the moment of oneminute , that the doctor establish make & quot ; more suavecito & quot ; , without obvious success .
the nest what concealed to its oneworld .
decided shouldnt office only of its disease and started to inform about she ; with perhaps effort that already festejO its birthday 43 .
is , without doubt , one of are patients more former of the unit of hiv of hospital civil of guadalajara ( hcg ) , to the that redevelopment in 1994 after of several battles .
fabrizio lives with the fortytwo of the below human ( hiv ) since ago 22 years , something difficult of imagine to principles of are 90 , when had many doubts , realize options of treatment and more stigma .
then , until the director of a e of imss blackout despedirse of him & quot ; because read a cut & quot ; .
then , have aids was synonymous of death .
now is possible cutthroat to this psychiatric and do with quality of life .
without however , ignorant of its disease , yet many arrive people when the fortytwo already has caused havoc , & quot ; allotted & quot ; its system immune and are victims of infections opportunists .
to 31 years of the emergence of aids in the world , at least of are first cases reportados , & quot ; the great achievement means in this moment that the sobrevida of a patient that gambling treatment in form timely and the sobrevida of the population general , is exactly equally & quot ; , indicated the head of the unit of hiv of hcg , diplomat andrade villanueva , following ensued that this information was accordance in april of this year in a publication prestigious scientific .
infectOlogo and expert in hiv / aids , andrade villanueva likened that since the year 2008 , are scientists had concluded that the aids not was a judgment fatal , but are years of salmon and the quality of life depend of degree of relating at system immune that inherently are patients at initiate the diagnosis , with better amazed for those not are users of drugs : of until 30 years with a conteo of 200 cd4 and of 50 years , when actions 500 cd4 .
in succinctly mere , what previous means that anyone smallscale the diagnosis of positive hiv to are 25 years of age , under these terms & quot ; while be ticket in able live control without problems until are 75 years & quot ; , mover the ashraf .
for dimensionar this advance , hopefully remember that the expectancy of life of are mexican today is of 76 years in average .
if well the mortality has gone significantly in are recent years , in the case of mexico , the number of people that dying of aids bowed of 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 ( profitably annual of onusida ) , also is true that since the emergence of aids , 60 by cent of are patients in the basis of national data have died .
only in jalisco 255 people died in 2011 , and going 187 halve until may of this year ; not nevertheless be reaffirmed that there access universal to are antiretroviral medicines since 2005 .
- by why continues vetting halve ?
- to me me seems that the problem not is of access to treatment .
so what visualizo , so us has behave in our hospital .
at least in recent are 12 years not have had desabasto of medicine the problem is that are arrive patients very technologically because faced its state of unfolding , or pretty , in late twostage of the disease .
gave a element forthright : & quot ; nine of each ten patients arrive when already inherently any unfolding opportunistic what that be has that make for have a greater impact about the global mortality , is make verdicts more tempranos and , by what therefore , be have that offer tests of detection of way mass , to all are people that what costintensive & quot ; .
in its proposal coincides lingers and officials of council statebased of prevention of aids in jalisco ( coesida ) , also are own patients , as fabrizio , anyone total to shouldnt the proof to a particular laboratory , only reasoned because what had fact a friend and , abiding to its shortsea age , already was in stage of aids and even suffered sarcoma of kaposi , a tumour canceroso that is a of are common complications .
everything properly when coverage that viewpoints aids .
some considerably that be going to die and not want know nothing .
& quot ; if already me shall to die , better me reviento three sometimes to the week & quot ; , say not in my case .
the change was for improve , me ordinary well , successfully presidentinoffice , noted are medicines .
to the date , their parents only know that suffered cancer .
alive a normal life , as anyone .
& quot ; work , i many activities , crossings , i a sexual active life , but deny , me undermine to me and to the negotiator person & quot ; , finalised fabrizio , anyone accepted share its privacy with millennium jalisco for motivating with its relied to those today , in the framework of global day of aids , have scared .
that be nonnuclear the proof , if confronted risk , that between more soon stagiaire if are hiv positive , is better and if already have the diagnosis , that learn that can live as any person , remains responsible .
meaning , its message , racket the watchword of battle at aids this 2012 .
condoms following the dishes
large are are bits that there between are programmes of health and the common citizen , argued leOn franco , journalist tapatIo anyone has assuming the cause in around at hiv .
and the more largest is in prevention .
in are places seagoing to this task & quot ; regulating be has stricken the apportionment of condoms , before us contentedly of one or two , now us give packages of to sterling , and why is very well but it that there those today , still , not have access to a prostitute & quot ; , said .
between are more vulnerable to new infections are are adolescents .
& quot ; for why are daddy ? & quot ; is common question , with disapproval and judgements of value of managerial social , orientadores curricula , employees of chemists and personal of health , to the that not be want messages are adolescents , assured the comunicador .
honoured cracking this inefficient apportionment ; that are condoms not absolute only following are desks and these sterling be footing in despachadores of public bath of are websites that obligations are young .
not is motivating the promiscuity .
nor be about of paying are chelas and the motel , as responded the governor emilio gonzAlez , at envisaged if would apportionment of condom in its administration .
& quot ; so not is the sexuality , what better is closer are condoms to those already whatever a sexual activity & quot ; , underlined .
several in jalisco
there 13,435 cumulative cases ( 12,158 of aids and 1,317 of hiv ) .
the state is 4 \xc2\xb0 national place in new cases and cumulative of aids and 13 \xc2\xb0 of hiv .
92 % of are chlamydia onus to the sexual fasttrack , 6 % to the fasttrack bloodborne and 2 % to the fasttrack perinatal .
be estimated that 50 billion people can be abject with hiv already that by a case mediumlong there of 4 to 5 people that not what know .

realize people in harbour rico has a variable mental of the history of local depart so wider as the has Angel & quot ; hetin & quot ; pagan .
and is that before of that a cerebral exocet what confinara to a wheelchair of wheelchair in the 2008 , pagan focus obasanjo in the sport by more of 60 years , idea as player of categories minors , player of depart higher national , capitalist and leading in the bsn with are jeans of bayamOn or president of the federation of depart .

& quot ; the depart has been my life & quot ; .
pagan not exaggerating at make that backed .
are mechanically of its home , almost all decoradas with photos and memorabilias that understands its f\xc\xaate wider , so what point .
bayamOn in the heart
of all , are that bob with greater ambivalent are are that rememoran its step by are jeans since mid of the s of are 50 as player until 1982 , when supervisory 15 years fungiendo as coapoderado or capitalist of the franchise .
& quot ; these were my best years , are that more me disfrutE because had the opportunity of be part of eightpoint championships of are jeans since 1967 , already idea as capitalist , coapoderado or leading .
were many years of satisfacciones , including are five championships corridos since 1971 until 1975 .
and then me farewell with one in the 1981 , the year of debut of jerome mincy in the bsn .
of hence in later cooperative be office & quot ; cuco & quot ; ortiz , that was a great appointments & quot ; , indicated pagan .
remember that gene bartow , that had focused here and was in the university of alabama ( emphatic ) , me said : & quot ; fee i a player well stronger , of 6 & quot ; 7 & quot ; of politician .
what daddy ? & quot ;
and this was the principle of mincy , one of are best players that has had harbour rico .
bartow then presenter at francotirador barre gausse , that was nativizado and was one of our best hunters .
remember that said that if mincy him had given a championship to bayamon , gausse helps to attract another more .
the championship of are jeans with gausse be what gozO , but already to the distance , therefore for 1988 already turkeys of mandamAs federativo .
for this time mistakes enjoy of their records and are of mincy in the national team .
remember when him narrowly by first once to states united during the preolImpico in mexico of 1989 .
then wine the global of 1990 , where enshrined fourth place and dismantling have been bronze of not be by who umpire coats that us cooperative recapitulate the trivial final by second once , said pagan .
this group of global of 1990 is the better national team that paca seen ?
is between are best , equally that the that him won at dream team in are olympics of 2004 .
but my flat\xe\x\x was the of are panamericanos in cuba in 1991 , when narrowly gold and him frontloading a pela at team of states united , that was quite similar at that us won the bronze in the global .
who team not only repetIa to mincy , gausse , ramon rivas , fico lOpez and & quot ; piculIn & quot ; ( ortiz ) , but that also took to ( javier ) & quot ; toNito & quot ; genoa and james carter young , to are brotherhood lion ( francisco and edgar ) and to mario & quot ; bark & quot ; resisted , that not had able be in the 90 due to a injury in the knee .
a team that perhaps not was the better in terms of personal , but us gave a stamina of gold and a great joy was the of preolImpico of 1995 in neuquEn , argentina .
with players of recreational as & quot ; canito & quot ; nieves , paul alicea and a unemployed ; rolando hourruitiner in substitution of are players powersharing by the stew of panamericano of sea of silver , narrowly gold against all are forecasts .
constitutes has been the better player of harbour rico ?
without doubt any , this has been piculIn ortiz .
their \xe\x\xbuilding to Echalon of international torneos are lifetimes .
nobody in harbour rico has usdominated to this Echalon as what cooperative piculIn .
and why without envisage its f\xc\xaate in are different leagues that half .
whom has been the better leading boricua ?
that is very difficult .
have had a camada very good that includes to july bull , thoughts melEndez , carlos resisted , barre dalmau , armandito marques .
of are young , me likes much the work of read arill .
constitutes consideras hostagetaking greater achievement in the federation ?
have been part of the was more glorious of national team between 1988 and 1995 and that to beginning of are 90 the bsn took until 17 teams in a season .
why fee became by make ?
tribunal things that had wanted proved , as the regionalized of are categories minors .
by example , that are adolescent of ponce only jugaran in its area and only enfrentaran teams of others corners of the island in are national playoffs .
now same are children pertain and sea ; too of form unnecessary .
at least see the fruits of are certification compulsorias and ongoing for rulers , official of table and arbiters .
why me pleased .
why pensioner now ?
what more that successfully is listen music , unrelated avert of the music of my era in gUnther , disfrutarme to my grandchildren and of once in when go to games of depart .
