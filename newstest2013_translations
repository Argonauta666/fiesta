a strategy extent for hinder the re-election of obama 
the leaders republicans justify their policy by the need of fight against the fraud electoral . 
now well , the centre brennan as this last a myth and says that the fraud electoral is least often in the states united that the number of people that die to cause of the fall of a glimmer . 
of fact , the lawyers republicans not have found more that 300 cases of fraud electoral in the states united in ten years . 
a thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation . 
in that sense , these measures minarAn in part the system democratic american . 
to contrary of what that happens in canada , the states american are responsible of the organisation of the elections federal in the states united . 
and in that same line a majority of the governments american instance , to from of 2009 , new laws that cancelled the process of register or of vote . 
this phenomenon is has widespread after the elections of november of 2010 , that were the increase of 675 new representatives republicans in 26 states . 
in result , during the year 2011 is introduced u-turn projects of law that assembly the exercise of right of vote in 41 states . 
the new laws election demand that the constituents be a document of identity with a was , also of a test of citizenship american . 
by other part , these laws reduced the periods of vote early-voting , invalidan the right to enrol as forrester in the day of polling and couple their right to vote to the citizens with background criminal . 
before of the elections of 2006 , no state american requirements that the constituents presentaran a document of identity with was . 
the state of indiana was the first in demand . 
the court supreme of the states united this in 2008 the being of the law of indiana . 
by this , the authorities republicanas is quick to extend that practice to other states . 
in the last years these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 states for force to the constituents to it a document of identity with was . 
is important have in account that , to contrary of what that is in quebec , the citizens american not have of a document of identity universal , as the card of the security social . 
of fact , a 11 % of the citizens american , is say , 21 million of people in age of vote , not have with no document of identity with was we by a agency government of their state . 
by another hand , five million of new constituents in 2012 not of a document of identity with these characteristics . 
but , to often , the obtaining of document of identity delays costs more of hundred dollars . 
with what which , the new restrictions affect of way disproportionate to the young , the minorities and the people with income netherlands . 
in effect , a 25 % of afroamericanos , a 15 % of people that who least of 35 dollars to year , a 18 % of the citizens of more of 65 years and a 20 % of the constituents of between 18 and 29 years not have with a document of identity with was . 
and still there more . 
in many states the students , the constituents that more vote to the candidates democrats , not can use the document of identity with was we by their institution . 
by other part , these ourselves states authorise to the member of the clubs of fishing or of hunting that usually vote to the parties republicans to use the documents issued by these clubs . 
before of 2004 no state requirements the test of citizenship for vote . 
arizona was the first state in it this demand . 
since 2011 , a dozen of states has adopted laws that demand that the constituents prove that are citizens american . 
these measures for , clearly , limit the vote hispano . 
seems be that two of every three constituents hispanos support to party democrat . 
by another hand , the legislators republicans supported in 2011 certain laws that abolIan the register of constituents the same day of polling in eight states . 
also , constrained the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the constituents that want enrol . 
these restrictions have consequences . 
by example , in the elections general of 2004 , the campaigns of register of the constituents contributed to registration of around of 10 million of citizens . 
the measures taken since 2009 reformation that the rate of register of new constituents out in 2010 in compared with the year 2006 . 
also , the legislators republicans adopted laws in other five states that importantly the reduction of period of vote by advance . 
by example , in the elections of 2008 in florida , a 33 % of the constituents that voted by advance were afroamericanos , while that these last not represented more that a 13 % of the constituents of state . 
in the case of the hispanos was exactly what same . 
these not represent more that a 11 % of the constituents , what that is to a 24 % of the citizens that vote by advance . 
without however , the white , that represent a 76 % of electorate , not represent more that the 46 % of the citizens that vote by advance . 
by course , the legislators democrats and their supporters is have conflicting desire to the adoption of laws that originating the registration of constituents . 
in this sense , the governors democrats have blocked several projects of law . 
the ministry tax of the states united intervened for decision the laws more controversial . 
is could , in part , limit the damage . 
by example , so only 16 of 34 states adopted the law that requirements the presentation of a document of identity with was . 
without however , is undeniable that the new rules taken complicarAn the exercise of right to vote in 2012 . 
the critical democrats have the nature firmly of the laws that is have voted , already that is clear that with them is to influence in the results of 2012 in the states key . 
a report of centre brennan of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent house of the 250-270 votes necessary in the school electoral for achieve the presidency . 
is too soon for say with certainty if these amendments legislative to level of system electoral will a impact significant in the results of the elections presidential of 2012 . 
a thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation . 
in this sense , the measures minarAn in part the system democratic american . 
detection of cancer of prostate : done the test or not apprising ? 
in effect , the test of psa is , in times , results definite , with counterfeit results negative or even counterfeit results positive , after the that is decided to speeches medical so . 
is a reason more that enough for do any to the men , already reticentes of by yes , on if should done or not the tests of detection . 
done the test or not ? 
we asked council to two specialists . 
in the studies by in the states united is was a great rate of chlamydia between the groups of shows , by what that is difficult read these data and do recommendations firm . 
by their part , the study european was certain difference of mortality between the patients that is had done the detection and the that not . 
the study , with a monitoring to the 12 years , proved also that there between the 30 and the 40 % of possibilities of chronically areas if not is has done the test of detection . 
recommend , by therefore , the test to from of the 50 years , or to from of the 40 years if your father has suffered cancer of prostate . 
the men of origin afroamericano have a rate of risk more high . 
the key is take a good decision a time outbreaks the cancer . 
there cancer aggressive and other cancer that are indolentes . 
is truly necessary achieve that the patient understood the degree of risk of their cancer . is you must offer all the options possible and not necessarily treat the cancer of prostate that not citizen-friendly against the life to long long-term , in whose case is must has more well by a surveillance active of the disease . 
today in day many men to the that is them has outbreaks a cancer not are treaties , since that said cancer not is aggressive or one a risk for their life . 
in their place , them we a surveillance active of the disease and , if this ahead , them we a treatment . 
determinamos every time with more often criteria precise for decide who should or not be treaty . 
recommend that is do the test in any case . 
but is important that about with their doctor for determine if must done the test or not . 
movember has created , in cooperation with the society international of urologIa , a tool that allows assess the pros and the pros of test of psa . 
is can onto this document ( by the time only in english , but is grants spending within of little ) in the next direction : http : / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens-health / prostate-cancer-screening 
prevent the disease 
unfortunately , not there a recipe miracle for prevent the cancer . 
to despite of the progress of the research , the adoption of habits of life made are being the better way of reduce the risks of have the disease . 
believe that if all the world comiera well and is certainly what enough , is could prevent a 30 % of the cancer . 
&apos; if nobody everywhere , that rate is 2.7 , to least , to 50 % &apos; , underlines andrE beaulieu , spokesman of the society canadian against the cancer . 
in change , evaluamos that around of 10 % of the cancer are inherited . 
many other are being completely explainable . 
for the society canadian against the cancer , the fight against the smoking still being a priority to despite of the drop of number of smokers . 
the tobacco is with with the 85 % of the cases of cancer of lung . 
is , also , a factor of risk for other types of cancer . 
particularly us the health of the people . 
&apos; today by today , still there 1.5 million of smokers in quebec &apos; , declared the spokesman andrE beaulieu . 
a fact hopeful : 10 years after of stop of smoking , the risk of die of cancer is reduces to the half . 
the weight 
the gordura and the obesity help also the emergence of the disease , according the scc . 
poorly the risks of cancer of breast , of bowel and of totally , of bathing-water , of pAncreas and of womb . 
&apos; the research shown that the practice regulate of activity physical during all the life protects against the cancer of breast &apos; , in . 
the food 
the body should , also , limit the consumption of it red . 
in large quantities , do career the risks of have a cancer colorectal . 
the products of charcuterIa also must avoided . 
the conservation of the meat for their ahumado , dried or delicious can cause the training of substances carcinogenic . 
&apos; can damage the cells of body and carry to development of cancer &apos; , we for . 
the vitamins 
in the last years , several scientists have examined the links between the complex correctly and the cancer . 
without however , by the time their research not are bombing . 
segU the scc , the studies about of the e and are contradictory . 
while that in one of them is discovered a drop of the risks of cancer of prostate , in another what that is observed was , more well , a increase . 
the effect of the e d in the cancer not is has been determine with clarity . 
by other part , gijs beaulieu should in the importance of about on the concerns and the background family of every one with their doctor . 
&apos; do the test of detection not from cancer . &apos; 
the bosOn of higgs in detail 
the announcement of likely discovery of bosOn of higgs equal a great shock the summer last , and with reason . 
is believes , in effect , that this bosOn is involve of mechanism responsible of the mass of all what that there in the universe , nothing more and nothing least . 
and what that is more , is is of the partIcula whose existence unusual the model standard : our better or &apos; least bad &apos; explanation of the nature and of behaviour of the on , that still not has been seen economically . 
but for the physical not is completely clear that is involved of higgs . 
know without place to doubt that there a new partIcula and that is seems much to bosOn of higgs predicted by the model standard . 
also , new data desvelados this week in a important congress of physical fact in kyoto seem confirm that yes what is , although still and more data for be completely insurance . 
of all ways , assume that is is of higgs , already that the possibilities of get seem few . will of what is is . 
there , in this great world , a law widespread and absolutely that means that two things not can found in the same place to same time . 
not there way of broad that rule and not what trying too , because will gaining damage . 
although the physical of the particles be a world very complex , is has shown that also in she there a law of these characteristics : the principle of exclusion of pauli , that stipulates that two particles not can should the same space to same time if are in the same &apos; state cuAntico &apos; ; a &apos; state &apos; that certain , achieve way , of some of their characteristics . 
the physical classify the particles in two categories . 
by a part we are with the good citizens called fermiones , that supporting wisely to principle of pauli . 
and by other are the bosones , a dosage buffoons of anarquistas that not has respect by nothing , or to least not by this principle , what that means that can found in the same place and to same time . 
according the indeed website the particle adventure of the laboratories berkeley that , by true , is extraordinary , the bosones is into in two groups : the breweries , of the that not we here , and the &apos; particles of force &apos; , by the that the large forces of the nature is epidemic and with the which the bosOn of higgs would of any way emparentado . 
these bosones , be stress here , not are the bichos exOticos that could believe . 
of fact , if there read this risk , is thank to a bosOn extremely trivial : the fotOn or the &apos; partIcula of light &apos; that acts as &apos; bringing &apos; of the force electromagnetic . 
in effect , when a partIcula with a burden we accelerates or time of direction , &apos; desordena &apos; the field electromagnEtico in that be environment ; a little as when we a stone to a dig . 
in this &apos; point &apos; stems a wavelength electromagnetic ( of the light , of the infrared , of the appalling , etc ) , and this wavelength not is other thing that a fotOn ; is say , one of the bosones &apos; carriers of force &apos; . 
field more stable 
happens what same with the bosOn of higgs , with the difference of that is is of another field , the field of higgs , that needs be &apos; desordenado &apos; for that this bosOn hang . 
now well , the field of higgs is great more stable that the field electromagnEtico . for activarlo ago lack come to energy extremely do , a little as if is like of a dig came in the that so only a rock gruesa could avoid by the surface . 
by this ago lack a in put of particles as the of the cern ( the great colisionador of hadrones is a ring of 27 km of 314 ! ) for achieve such levels of energy . 
the analogy with the field electromagnEtico is a new tool that explains the relationship between the higgs and the mass . 
of fact , not all the particles or all the materials blundell with the field electromagnEtico . 
some , as the eradicate , what do , but other not : a paper of role , by example , not is will never by yes same grass-roots to the door of a begin . 
and of the same way , not all the particles blundell with the field of higgs : the that what do have a mass , while that the rest ( how the fotOn , by true ) , not the have . 
now well , what &apos; can they &apos; all these research ? , question the madam plamondon . 
for the science , this serves for verify the validity of model standard ( ms ) , and allows , also , that the physical escrutinen the differences between the comments and the predictions of ms . 
by their part , many want desire that is who , therefore the less difference could open a door to a &apos; new physical &apos; that tape certain holes of model . 
this , there that say , has still enormous shortcomings , as that not proposes explanation any on to the serious ( ups ! ) or to the on brown-skinned , that constitutes around of 80 % of the on of universe ( another ups ! ) . 
but not we found such differences in the cern to the time . 
impact 
the impact of these research in our day to day are difficult of predict , but not we that we let to say that not will no . 
for that just : to at of the years 60 , the pioneers of infrared in the laboratories not sospechaban in all the revolution that their jobs provocarIan . 
entreveIan the applications scientific , but nothing more . 
of fact , as already said the physical willard boyle , that worked in the laboratories bell , where is invented the infrared in 1960 , and that booklet the first infrared beside ( the first were pulsados ) in 1962 , to principle the infrared was more well considered a &apos; course of laboratory &apos; . 
imagine ... 
and also , the applications can also proceed of all the implementing that are to the research . 
by example , the same willard boyle booklet a captador of light in 1969 in the course of their research in on of angles . 
to despite of that not was in all their intention original , this captador serves now of &apos; eye &apos; for all the equipment digital of world , what that you apocalyptic the nobel of physical in 2009 . 
that not want say , by course , that the activities of lhc want necessarily into our lives , but that never is know ... 
care palliative . the better way of die ... &#124; you devoir 
in their commission die in dignity , quebec indian recently the sensitive question of end of the life . 
the debate must joined soon while is indication a project of law . 
now well , within of that dominance essential , still there much that do . 
you devoir has tried see of close . 
ago hardly a weeks , the mr l. living only in their flat of the montErEgie . 
the cancer of prostate that you was destroying you had given a four-year of two years . 
&apos; i had given five years of life , but already i so seven &apos; , mark , fact a is , tumbado in their bed in the centre of care palliative victor-gadbois of beloeil , to the that was the day previous . 
&apos; but always is a shock , not we be prepared for this &apos; , continues . 
the disease you has caused havoc : a weakness huge that you from go only to bathing and even feed by yes only . 
at with to a apetitoso lunch , will mood that you help to feed . 
purposeful , comes even to he , to about with the unknown that you play attention , you bring medicines and you offered a bathing . 
the courage of the death ordinary . 
&apos; my greater i is that i curen the diarrhoeal , is humiliating &apos; , admits . 
a hours more later , the team found no to that bad . 
&apos; in the course of our lives projects that a man ago pis of ordinary &apos; , mark pierre brodeur , fariNas in the centre victor-gadbois . 
return to their childhood , for certain people , is a humiliation unacceptable . 
&apos; that on of the capacity of the person for accept that regression &apos; , complaints . 
because , according the opinion of the majority of the people that working in care palliative , the large at have place in the heart same of that regression . 
all the patients that entering in the centre of care palliative victor-gadbois from cancer . 
have a prognosis of life maximum of three months . 
in that state , the team of doctors and nurses that them around already not offered the care &apos; curative &apos; . 
the greater fear of the mrs by , of 89 years , is die &apos; aware and ahogada &apos; . 
but the disease you has fact be to their children . 
&apos; i a good children &apos; , adds . 
&apos; already not i are more wishes in this life &apos; , says , before of accept that is you long a mascarilla for her to breathe . 
and expected , in the next days , a last visit of their son that live in italy . 
in victor-gadbois is offers , with a group of voluntary , the care of body and aid to the food . 
are care palliative that is them give when not is can do nothing more . 
for help to that their death be more confortable . 
in quebec we with a bed of care palliative for every ! inhabitants . 
is very little , already that know that all will die some day . 
here , the life continues in the best conditions possible , explains the closest christiane martel , a of the female of centre . 
already be to level of comfort physical , emotional or spiritual . 
to moribundo is you offered enjuagues of their with brandy or pepsi , according the demand . 
to the diabetics already not is them controls their rate of sugar . 
the death way part of what everyday . 
yesterday by the night you uses a beer to mr x , that died in the course of the night . 
this morning , their son is end the beer to the feet of inspired . 
&apos; helping therefore to the patients as to their beings loved &apos; , mark Elisabeth savard , director of the care . 
in the centre victor-gadbois the days discussions without be never equal . 
to hand of a man of 94 years that saborea their last meeting family in the yard , well was between their almohadas while all drink to their health , a young of 36 years dies of way tragic , surrounded by their parents , their woman and their two children , after have tried all for survive . 
&apos; since ago six months , always there of three to five beds held by people under of 45 years that of cancer &apos; , is concerned the closest christiane martel . 
a 53 % of the patients that are admitted in the centre victor-gadboisarrivent next of their home and a 47 % of hospital . 
problem of access to care palliative 
a 77 % of the canadians simply not has access to the care palliative , is say , to the care some for alleviate the suffering when a ill comes to the stage terminal of their life , be in their home , in the hospital or in a centre of care . 
and several bodies , as the centre victor-gadbois and the society of care palliative to home of continued montrEal , is especializan almost exclusively in the care of the patients with cancer . 
is precisely that great we on in the care health of quebec what that ago that many doctors mentions in care palliative farmer the adoption of a law that brought the euthanasia and the suicide attended . 
since the month of october , a clear signed by eminencias of the care palliative , as the dr balfour mount and the dr albert lapointe , everything for demonstrate their opposition to such initiative . 
according the closest christiane martel , the system health of quebec not is what enough responsible as for ensure that who have right to care palliative of quality before of that is accept proceed with the euthanasia . 
&apos; recently &apos; , mark , &apos; i seen to a patient through 14 days in topical suffering large other without that is has fact what necessary for relieve . 
fear that the patients who die only because not receive the care produce &apos; . 
and parallel , many oncOlogos is obstinan with their patients to the last day , to despite of the worst prospects . 
the hopes of survival of hElène richard were already under minimum when he a treatment of showed exhausting . 
&apos; when you i to my oncOloga that wanted stop the treatment , she i said that you its very worth that i stop of fight &apos; , mark . 
&apos; without however , she i had said that not had nothing more that do ! &apos; 
not there care todopoderosos 
the closest martel believes that a 90 % of the people that considerably die grateful to their carers that not them have dealt in their demands a time is them has relieved their pain thank to a team of care palliative . 
but there that say that the care palliative not are absolutely todopoderosos in what that as to treatment of pain . 
according elsie monereau , director of the care palliative to home of continued montrEal , the patients not they to the treatments against the pain in a 8 % of the cases . 
to end of the life , the doctors usually resort to the sedating palliative , that serves for ball to patient to the time of their abortions , already be of way circumventing or of way permanent . 
not we pretend that not understand that part of suffering . 
every time more , the disease not minds will to have the possibility of have that sedating palliative . 
the people that not are aliviados say all what same : &apos; i i die &apos; . 
but that not want say necessarily &apos; i the euthanasia &apos; , but &apos; i that i alivien &apos; . 
the realisation of this exploit has been possible thank to a scholarships of journalism of the institutes of research of health of canada . 
escAndalos account of great as in quebec 
officials of the network road , employers of btp , collector of funds of parties political and specialists of the mafia italian have , day after day , what that know of a exclusively &apos; system &apos; , of that form part the industry of the construction , officials , political , unionists and landing . 
a &apos; industry &apos; that went too expensive to the taxpayers natives , on all in the years 1990 and 2000 . 
&apos; is , how the system is pulveriza a time we head-hunted to the large media &apos; , ironiza jacques duchesneau , member in quebec and former head of the police of montreal . 
he liderO the outbreak of scandal in 2011 , that was possible thank to a research to fund on the governance linked to contracts of roads in quebec , that the first minister liberal of that time , jean charest , not had consented more that in delay . 
the &apos; report duchesneau &apos; set a link direct between the industry , the funding illegal of the parties and the corruption between officials . 
&apos; since the start of the research in 2010 , so only the ministry of transport is would saved thousand million of dollars in contracts &apos; , analysing some of their shared of stay with a part proportional . 
the commission charbonneau &apos; already has fact fall to two mayors &apos; , adds , while expected power come to &apos; demonstrate the manner existing behind of the individuals &apos; . 
a unit permanent corruption , created in 2011 
the unit permanent corruption , created in 2011 , is applies also with their team of controllers , researchers and analysts of government . 
this unit works also of the police of &apos; the drawn marteau &apos; , that , since 2009 , have fact that the &apos; cartel of fast-expanding &apos; of montreal is modere to the time of comes contracts . 
these last weeks , the unit has allowed to registration in series of the accusations by fraud and corruption against charges municipal as frank zampino and richard marcotte , mayor of a city of the outside . 
the next of the list would savary vaillancourt , that has of resign of their since of mayor of laval , third city of quebec . 
is suspicion that is has embolsado bombing bribery to change of contracts public . 
is has accused formally to engineers of the network road of montreal and to employers of origin italian , as tony accurso and flax zambito . 
this last has caused shock to explain to the commission the mechanics of &apos; system &apos; of obtaining of contracts public . 
he same paid during three years a 3 % of value of the contracts bad in montreal to a broker concerned to the mafia that transfiriO the money to dimension montrEal , the party of mayor gErald tremblay . 
gijs zambito repartiO money to are and are during the years 2000 , granting more of 4.8 dollars canadians ( a 68 eur ) to parties provincial , on all to the liberals in the power . 
admitted , also , have organised a collection of funds illegal for the ex-viceprimera minister liberal , Elisabeth normandeau . 
the inflation of cost of the contracts of fast-expanding 
in montreal , the &apos; system &apos; of corruption did with effectively . 
savary surprenant , exingeniero of works public , what he perfectly to the commission : in ten years received are , inviting to travel , torneos of golf , restaurants , parties of championships and bribery of companies of sector of the construction by a total of 736.000 dollars , all this to change of contracts of fast-expanding whose costs drawn . 
other officials of the network road have admitted that received money by comes the bills between a 30 % and a 40 % in concept of counterfeit extra . 
also , a organizing of party of mayor , martin dumont , was to gijs tremblay of have fact the view blind deliberately to a budget parallel and country their coffers of money dirty . 
to as of these revelations , gijs tremblay resigned to principles of november and was to montreal to a crisis huge . 
chantal rouleau was a of the first policies ourselves of montreal that was sounding the alarm . 
as mayor-making of district of rivière-des-prairies , in the this of the island , is opposed since 2010 to the sale of a ground municipal on by 5 million of dollars and revendido by ones million to the promoters in plenary boom estate . 
the 70 % of money of the campaigns election was money dirty 
of the research that finally is will to out , she will that light &apos; of a balance for power understand the functioning of system , infiltrado by hormigas , for stop the gangrena and fishing to the guilty &apos; . 
and adds that the process is &apos; painful , but positive &apos; . 
we christmas the injured but would lack a unit of research clean in montreal and be very warning for that the practices dubious not is not . 
how do the have . 
regularly . 
jacques duchesneau , by their part , states that &apos; the officials have stolen hundreds of million of dollars &apos; , but is inquieto on all by the role of the &apos; &apos; political elected to aware of the contrivance &apos; . 
estimando in a 70 % the proportion of money dirty that is on to the funding of campaigns election in quebec , ironiza : &apos; i have said that that not is more that a for a of the reality &apos; . 
the government quebequEs proposes limit to 100 dollars the donations to parties , but that not will the donation , according he , &apos; while not is speaking strictly the expenses election , will money dirty in the policy &apos; . 
answers a review full of system of fair of contracts public and of funding of the parties : &apos; not we fall more under ; go to fund of the things , with courage , we will rebuild the home with a foundations more solid , with more controls and laws &apos; . 
if this history pleasure the image international of quebec and of montreal , gijs duchesneau attend to those that is laughing to take to mirror . 
&apos; the psg not is the fc barcelona ! &apos; 
this season has on a new entity with the psg . 
how behind that progress ? 
is could explain by a decision-making of awareness individual , but also by the new dimension of psg . 
have come large players . 
avanzo of day in day to their hand . 
the personal technical also i has great much . 
and these elements i same to daily to raise the level of my at . 
in a party , that is more easy . 
all will very rapid in the football . 
but i not i acaloro . 
since my at in the centre of preformaciOn of inf clairefontaine to my step by saint-etienne , always i progress to steps leaps . 
will to obtain benefit of the competition reclutada by carlo ancelotti . 
the recruitment of this summer are used to also parties of very high level . 
know that every experience is crucial . 
that ago that a player as i have wish of fight and take all . 
by other part , carlo ancelotti i provided much in as to my enabled . 
is supported by deputy as claude makelele , that jugaba in the same position that i . 
ancelotti is the man that needed the team ? 
by course . 
ancelotti inspires respect to all the technical . 
today by today , not there nobody as in the league 1 and is between the best entrenadores european . 
has a great experience and has cattle many titles with the best clubs . 
has worked with large players . 
i that is will other titles in paris . 
in january i a conversation very comforting with he . 
i had of out of a series of injury . 
the confidence that has in me explains also my good performance . 
what think on the psg in the first part of the season ? 
in the league 1 , lyon we has taken the since of leader . 
but we in the ambush . 
one of our elderly objectives is the league of champions : we we heading for the octavos of end with lifestyle . 
what is the aim of club in this competition ? 
we to treat of come what more far possible . 
to from of now , can through any thing . 
but we much that say with to many and very good equipment european . 
want , for start , end the first of our league with to oporto for power receive the back of octavos of end . 
the psg can become in a great club european to short long-term ? 
already has the budget ... 
for become in a great club european , paris has that win titles and be there to long long-term . 
today by today , that not is the case . 
to level economic , the psg is given to their media for that that project is never . 
not win the cup in the league 1 , as in the last season , would a great failure ? 
by course , would a great disappointment .

in view of the sums alas , you imaginarIamos with 15 points of advantage to the but . 
that would allow to our opponents and the championship of france . 
lyon and marseille , that not were well the season previous , is have seen &apos; powered &apos; by this new psg .

that at we was confidence . 
every one peleO by all . 
before of that shock in spain , not had through a at be in all my career . 
with bitcoin , pay and sell without banks 
all what contrary to the exchanges monetary current , based in the banks central , the transactions buried and the burdens of prosecution between the parties . 
also , as to often happens in the technologies , the vision policy is breach : the conviction of that the system monetary current , up of monopolies banking , has to the crisis financial . 
of fact , bitcoin , invented by satoshi nakamoto ( a pseudOnimo ) , is to the time a currency virtual converted to dollars , eur , etc and a protocol of change sure to the way of bittorrent , that allows the exchange of file of as to as . 
is have reported close of 200 transactions thank to 15 computers of the network . 
and close of a thousand websites website accepted the bitcoins as donations or as way of payment . 
the prices of bitcoin , after have come to the top of 30 dollars ( 23 eur ) in june of 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months more later , before of again today to back the ten dollars ( the contributions is censan in the indeed bitcoincharts.com ) . 
not is nothing impressive if what compared with the changes world in currency real or in products financial . 
without however , the bank central european ( ecb ) is was by he in a report on the coins lot published in october . 
in he , is described the bitcoin as &apos; the currency virtual with more success &apos; , &apos; that compete with the dollar or the euro &apos; and &apos; similar to the coins conventional &apos; . 
bitcoin is difference of other systems with types of coins lot as the &apos; appropriations &apos; , used for move in a vIdeojuego and that is can win playing or is can buy ( and even in times canjear ) . 
the network social facebook developed also this kind of system . 
but in all exchange a authority central controls and is the changes . 
with the bitcoin , all the nodes of network are to the time mentioned of books of accounting , described , issuers of currency and buyers and sellers . 
how works that network ? 
every compromise between two users is ago in reality between two directions electronic in way of e-mail electronic . 
a user can choose a direction different for every payment , thus so the kid-glove . 
a whole of information linked to this compromise is signing electronically to through of a system of evidence to double key . 
the network can so verify the authenticity of the compromise . 
thank to content of file , is also possible ensure that the changes of bitcoins will in the book of accounts public , that is disseminate by all the network . 
the milestone key is in write that new compromise in that book . 
this is by the resolution of a challenge mathematics it to the computers and the winner , a kind of banker central provisional , will the privileged of add that line supplementary . 
is is of a stage of troceado of file , is say , of transformation of a great file in a left numerical more short and only . 
the computers &apos; doing &apos; the new compromise and in a number before of &apos; trocear &apos; the whole . 
the aim is find the number that will a left particular ( more off to principle ) . 
a time that is is that number , the other nodes verifican easily that is the good . 
the compromise is is then indestructiblemente people to the chain of joint of the other transactions ; all change replaced the left . 
if , for commit a fraud , a user i pay two sometimes with the same money very rapid ( in least of ten minutes ) , the network only accept as along a of the two transactions ; the other is would huErfana , already that both have fingerprinting different . 
the computer that opportunity the challenge is has 50 bitcoins . 
for avoid the inflation , that to is into in two regularly , with likelihood before of end of 2012 . 
the number of bitcoins in movement is , therefore , limited to 21 million , but are divisible to the cienmillonEsimo , what that is a for broader . 
the difficulty of this challenge is reveals also in every increase of the power of calculation . 
the life of the network has already their downs . 
the websites website that offered services for bitcoin have been attacked and is have stolen bitcoins in by . 
&apos; the failure used not affects to same protocol &apos; , will pierre noizat , that has of launch paymium , a company of payment in currency real that used the network bitcoin . 
the ecb has in account also the possibilities of blanquo of money thank to this service anonymous . 
but the money in effective is the same fault . 
the players of weight as goes reject the payments of this kind . 
other , as the platform wordpress , the accepted . 
recently , adi shamir and dorit rum , of insitito weizmann in israel , carried the book of accounting and were that close of 80 % of bitcoins not everything . 
in november is were the &apos; cheap giants &apos; . 
&apos; is changed 30,000 dollars &apos; , is regocija jon holmquist , that working for coinabul , that becomes the bitcoins in gold . 
pierre noizat , author of a book constituted on that currency , believes quite in the potential of this technology also of in the network of transactions . 
their system , paytunia , is to a card of credit ( in currency real ) or to a payment by mobile without contact , but used bitcoin for relevant the transactions , that so out more cheap . 
the carrying , also , managed their identity and can , by therefore , remain in the kid-glove . 
the system is easy of to in into in the shops , that not have that on new intermodal or softwares . 
them enough with supply a direction that a telephone can &apos; fotografiar and recognise &apos; , precise pierre noizat , that will have thousands of users . 
there a movement general of review of the systems aggressor by systems more horizontal . 
&apos; will lack a time for that bitcoin is will , but in 2013 could have a change &apos; , predice . 
by other part , in their report the ecb no enhance the risks various , today who higher , in case of that this currency have success . 
we out of afghanistan . 
and after ? 
the troops french abandoned their area of responsibility in afghanistan ( kapisa and surobi ) . 
the nato and the american must out to purposes of 2014 . 
is time of that the army out truly possession of their territory and that the afghan choosing their future , without wait nothing of us . 
we aside on all to the farmers afghan , to the that we considered terrorists . 
and to us ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , more the injured and the maimed . 
the taliban have with extremist foreign and old heads refugees in pakistan , but to often also with farmers that reject the presence of army abroad , as in the times of the soviet . 
want defend their traditions , old and arcaicas , even if to their causes is between the jihadist , the clearest , the arab , the uzbecos or the tayikos . 
tolerados , to sometimes even helped by the insurgents local , they already not what will when the western is do more discreet . 
the starting of the troops french of the basis of nijrab , that i since what high of the bangladeshi further of almendros thank to the appropriations french , is was by order . 
the convoys of lorry and of tanks assad to kabul without have no attack , spotlight by the helicopters . 
not will are of taliban in kabul to from of end of 2014 . 
the circumstances have changed since their progress irresistible between 1994 and 1996 . 
kabul was then we and the country dragged in ceasefire and blood to cause of the struggles between different factions . 
their decision-making of control of country had been perceived as a kind of release , the return to the security . 
the afghan have paid the price of obscurantism of their farmers behind by the organisation al-qaeda , but their situation not is better today . 
the old muyahidines , the government current and the current taliban shared the i of keep to the women in a position than . 
the main personalities of the war antisoviEtica only to power in 2001 . 
is have become in speculators , gaining with areas non-governmental for revenderlos as energy-producing for the refugees that have again of iran and pakistan , benefit to the couple of enormous contracts americans of trained . 
are desacreditados ; the majority of them not have fought . 
the people , according i heard in the field , is to a government that not is set by criminal . 
many young want leave , as also is iran the that have known profit of the generosity american : the brain of capital is considerable . 
the young are tired of the war and of their ideologies . 
have through the world modern during their exilios in iran or pakistan and have appreciated their advantages . 
with around of a 65 % of their population less of 25 years , kabul account now same with 5 million of inhabitants , a fifth part of the population total . 
in the cities , the schools state are in therefore of girls as of children . 
will that give work to these young that not will again to obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders . 
all , including the opposition armed , are or of mobile mobile . the television and their folletines turks that have a world modern has large matter in all the country . 
the army is now present . 
is assessment include the authorities that want you the country ? 
the old staff of the fight antisoviEtica is about already of rebuild the militias provincial , that huirAn of power central . 
afghanistan , country of mountains , of strong identities local , should power benefit of a certain decentralization to image of the nations western . without however , the states united what have wanted into in a state centralised , with a power presidential strong , removing the since of first minister that there since the constitution of 1964 . 
the president karzai not want the control abroad , in particular with reason of the elections will in april of 2014 . 
not however , their country on of the aid foreign since the years 50 and even before . 
no industry has reestablecido their services , not is has managed no embalse or is have repaired the systems of irrigation important . 
all is imported and not is is nothing exception fruit and vegetables . 
the priority is is to the initiative private . 
in a country ruined after 30 years of war , would been necessary the control government . 
is expandiO the rumour of that afghanistan possessed enormous profit coal-mining . 
and that not was more that increase the sense of that the western were there for seizing of them . 
without energy for from the mineral of iron or of it of ground and without media of transport for export to through of the mountains , not there exploitation mining . 
the chinese already almost have abandoned the mines of it of month aynak , being that the archaeologists international ( financed by the bank world ) excaven the in agonising bUdico and remain there as the employers more important of the province . 
will also lack that afghanistan and pakistan , country of that on widely the imports and the exports , restored their relations normal . 
the troops french left the 20 of november . 
the new treaty of cooperation no the continuation of the aid traditional : schools of girls , schools of children , a department of french in the university , the institute french , the cooperation in the areas military , legal , health and agricultural and the support to the delegation historical . 
since 2009 , with the subject of try &apos; who the hearts and the deal &apos; and of to the impossible task of do that the aid and the actions offensive coincidan , a service of &apos; actions civil and military &apos; of ministry of defence ( cimic ) , removed in 2012 , brought and was bring to through of a small ngos french many jobs of interest collective and actions of rehabilitation agricultural in tens of towns of mountain . 
these jobs , golosos of obtain hand of labour local , have been help to contain the uprising : irrigation , wells , water drinking , reforestation , trees fruit , protection solar and increase of land of cultivation . 
what we as i after two million of eur of expenses military ? 
a budget more well modest will to the improvement of the conditions of life local , very tough in these around located to often to more of 2 metres of all . 
the embassy received tens of demands written with small proposals agricultural made by communities local of the province of kapisa . 
for that is break of the uprising has to out by the groups foreign , something that the farmers i have said that want , would lack keep a small aid civil , well controlled and that them comes directly . 
a constitution with fOrceps in egypt 
is a new double or nothing of president followed morsi . 
while that egypt is more divided that never in as to the declaration constitutional , that you make provisionally powers a , he decided around the all by the all . 
by to all the world by surprise the wednesday , when announced that the house assembly would their text end to day next . 
ago so only a week , the head of state had given two months more to this house for end their jobs . 
and ago almost two years that egypt used a text provisional , several sometimes amended , what that it the stability institutional and has to embrollos judicial . 
this new initiative not has fact more that increase the fractured in the country . 
for their opponents , the president ethical in their &apos; away autocrAtico &apos; and continues &apos; betraying their word &apos; and &apos; trampling the right &apos; . 
by part of their supporters , is will that is is of a measure for end more rapid with the crisis institutional and policy and speed the process of transition . 
in the next 15 days should organised a referendum . 
a time of time very short that forced to the brothers to up to their project of explain the text , article by article , to the egyptians . 
for the president , is is also of a way of restore a being popular and democratic while the and cause havoc in all the country . 
followed morsi seems convinced of that the egyptians will to their favour , as stated in a interview to puts american time . 
recital that that appeal is has voted with very quickly , contains a ultimatum for the people egyptian : &apos; or vote my text or i the powers a &apos; , powers that supposed that to their end with the adoption of the constitution . 
is in that environment strange in the that 85 member of this house assembly , islamist in their great majority , voted the text yesterday . 
the majority of the liberals not turned to the call . 
to middle of november , a little before of the declaration constitutional , had closed the door because considered that not could do assert their points of view . 
the representatives of the rights human , the minorities religious and of the society civil did what same . 
to end of that is was the quorum necessary , yesterday by the morning is manner to 11 people , member substitutes , to all haste . 
some of them are very those to the brothers muslims . 
as expected wait , the articles highly-qualified what have been by unanimity . 
to the commentators them ago grace , by other part , the fact of that a of the few discrepancies of the but is has expressed virtually to the time of the sentence , therefore is so that several member of committee came to think that the clock of the assembly was bad . 
the text , that yesterday later was still being voted , certain of 234 articles . 
the article 2 , subject of all the expectations , still being finally same to of the constitution of 1971 , that horses that &apos; the principles of the sharia are the source main of right &apos; . 
the parties salafistas , for those the establishment of the law islamic is a vindication fundamental , were that is so replace &apos; the principles &apos; by &apos; the rules &apos; , what that would allowed a implementation more strict . 
for the islamists , that this article not has been amended is a guarantee of their good will and of their respect towards the other components of the society egyptian . 
the liberals what tachan of hypocrisy and they that not is is more that of a arisen advertising . 
according them , the islam of the constitution is ago to through of other articles . 
is refer , in special , to article 220 , that which to the university al-azhar a role advisory , in particular for all at that has of confirm their accordance with the laws of the sharia . 
according the specialist in egypt sophie pommier , is disturbing because &apos; the people so-called to upon not is elected and not has no legitimacy democratic . 
here detect the premises of a theocracy &apos; . 
the fears of the liberals is are also by by the fact of that the next rector of this university would quite least moderate that the current . 
&apos; by now , not there a involvement religious concrete . 
with this constitution we in the framework of state civil . 
the majority of the lawyers that have working in that text not are counter but university , some of them educated in the system french &apos; , explains alexis blouet , that indication a a on the transition constitutional egyptian . 
but recognised that can have certain ambiguity in about to article 220 , therefore the terms employees imitan the vocabulary religious . 
&apos; we talking in particular to term iqh &apos; justice islamic , ndlr &apos; . 
and the question that could be in the future would in what measure are the judges civil competent for upon by above of all this &apos; . 
more beyond of their nature religious , the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that is refer to the powers prevalent that which to president of the republic . 
the brothers muslims alegarAn that are few in compared with the that were during the previous regime . 
another point contention : the powers conferred to army . 
with to i of the military , the review of budget of defence not will subject to parliament , but to a council national of defence . 
not is banned the bundle of civil in courts military , as protestors the associations for the defence of the rights human . 
these also were their concerns relating to text , that they curtailing . 
the crime of blasphemy is maintained and , of now in forward , the insults are prohibited , what that could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression , on all the of the press . 
also , no article emphasises the protection of the women , underlines heba morayef , of human human watch . 
according she , what only positive has been the ban of the torture of agreement with the article 36 . 
the word not was in the constitution previous . 
although the president egyptian should out yesterday by the night in the television , is out demonstrations for this at . 
the supporters of head of state is demonstrated the saturday .

&apos; the large and powerful &apos; you will to moscow : immigrants savers for the language 
while members and defenders of the rights human discussing on the consequences that bring the law on the examination compulsory , already have appeared in the country con that trade with certified &apos; counterfeit &apos; 
every year , 13 million of workers immigrants they to moscow , st petersburg and other cities of russia .

without however , with the time , as promise in the service federal of immigration , the examinations is will obligatory for all the immigrants . 
also , not will enough with holding the examination of the language , if not also the of history russian and the of foundations of the legislation . 
the knowledge of the language is must confirm even for receive and renew the permit of work . 
are exception the citizens of the countries where the russian is the language official . 
not will subject to this law the people that reformation obtain their certified of education and qualifications before of the dissolution of the union soviet in 1991 .

what changes bring the mandatory of knowledge of the language , therefore for the russians as for the own immigrants ? 
in first place , they the representatives of service of immigration , this will reduce the number of people that suffer &apos; slavery labour &apos; . 
very people about today on the defence of the rights of the immigrants working , explains emmanuele sebelev , head of the representation of service federal of immigration of russia in tajikistan . 
the defence of their rights must cartoon before of their starting . 
only a system of selection organised will resolve the problem of the workers immigrants in a 90 % of the cases . 
the problems the have the immigrants without profession , education , the that not know the language or spend the control doctor . 
without the understanding of the language , says sebelev , the future immigrant is be condemned to find people without unscrupulous that , with the pretext of help , you pains a &apos; viajecito paid &apos; to a caging and close covacha , where he and dozens of other as he is that during months without food or documents , working of 12 to 14 hours to day . 
we a explanations of complaints of our immigrants . 
&apos; in their homeland them promise a thing , but to come are deceived , is them deprived of their passports , not them paid the wages desperately &apos; , confirms the head of the direction of immigration labour of service of immigration of tajikistan , tolib ruslan . 
not is enoje , jefecito ! 
without however , while therefore many citizens of the republics of asia central that want work in russia recognise that not only not know the language of country to that seek go , but that also in their language own write with difficulty . 
by course , this not is therefore their fault but their own unfortunately : are few the mongols , uzbecos , tayikos that they be the luxury of receive education primary normal . 
this is must to that their families even not have nothing that give of feed to the children , by not about already of vestirlos , calzarlos and comprarles what necessary for the school . 
to come to the adolescence , these boys is upheld to work to the first opportunity . 
is difficult , if not is know the language , recognise them . 
&apos; one is feel ayr and than &apos; . 
without however , in what that is concerns to the law on the language , the defenders of the rights guarding a point important . 
the examinations is will to out only for those immigrants whose status be legal . 
if not have that status , not will or examination and , in result , no work official . 
while therefore , the majority of the workers immigrants are living in russia illegally . 
&apos; welcome or ban the step to meet &apos; 
many visitors claim that receive the status official in our country not is so easy . 
the cause is in the obstacles bureaucratic and in the difficulties of the language in yes . 
also , the legalisation costs money : of twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rublos . 
without however , a register false is can do quickly and by only thousand over rublos . 
the employees of the police russian know that generally have documents counterfeit , not we registered and officer the cases of extortion . 
&apos; we they hundred or 10 rublos for cigarette or added &apos; , a to the journalists the citizen of tajikistan , umed hushkadamov . 
&apos; we , not wise tacaNo , buying a paint &apos; 
the first day of the entry in force of the law on the language , is that of clear that not only the documents of registration of immigrants can be counterfeit . 
several certified &apos; counterfeit &apos; of knowledge of the language already have been fake by officials of service federal of immigration . 
the documents counterfeit had been parental in impresoras standard of colour . 
by course , came to the hands of the new owners not as gift : every immigrant , queriEndose facilitate the task of through the evidence , paid by the document seven thousand rublos . 
this is two sometimes and half more expensive that the procedure official of examination , that cost to worker immigrant three thousand rublos . 
the main task for a future next is protect the system against the corruption for that the &apos; qualifications &apos; not is they buy , convergen the officials of government and the defenders of the rights . 
to the time , the authorities can promised to the workers immigrants that not would been through with success the examination the first time more time for look the course basic of the language . 
also , to the immigrants that not speak russian is them grants jobs that not require communication active with the people . 
the ministry of internal not decision-making measures down against the trade illegal of weapons 
the percentage of crimes committed with weapons registered is quite small 
the ministry of internal proposes apply the law with greater rigid in relationship to the owners of weapons of use civil . 
this is the reaction of government to the recent incidents : apretar correctly during distance of weddings in the that by fortunately not there victims , and the massacre must by the lawyer branch apollinaire vinogrAdov , in the that apretar seven people lost the life . 
the police want ban the use and the possession of weapons traumatic in places public and raise the age minimum for the obtaining of licence for portar weapons , of 18 years to 21 years . 
this idea was supported by the head of committee of the duma in on of security and fight against the corruption , irina yarovaya , who promised that the reforms in the law on the possession weapons will as to the duma of state in a future next . 
not all is feel pleased with the fact of that the authorities russian are trying of counter this problem becoming the &apos; policy of hand hard &apos; . 
in the network has appeared a letter open , whose authors , representatives of various organisations social of competitions , demand that is bear of such measures of &apos; rigurosidad without sense &apos; . 
the percentage of acts of things with use of weapons registered is minimum , a to service of news bbc of russia , the lawyer criminalista vasiliy lEsnikov . 
according statistics of ministry of internal , during six months of year 2012 is were 142 crimes with use of weapons of ceasefire registered in bodies of internal , with to total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period . 
the authors of the letter open are insurance of that a legislation more strict in the sector of weapons of use civil not will a these for that the criminal is contribute to market black . 
now , according their words , in moscow is can find any weapon to under price . 
while therefore , in the ministry of internal is says that the situation of the proliferation of weapons illegal is is under control . 
suppliers : since factories to official 
the market black of weapons is relies to through of several channels . 
the channels main are years , says the colonel withdrawn emmanuele baranets , who during ten years worked in the ministry of education and in the high state greater . 
caught of screen of website website that will orders of weapons 
the first , &apos; foothold of faction or military &apos; , is say , the weapons that were flown during the actions military in the caucasus . 
&apos; the weapons were hurtadas by the official russians and by the ourselves caucAsicos &apos; , says baranets . 
the next kind of &apos; weapon black &apos; , the flown by criminals and representatives of the forces of security . 
baranets explains that here is include the weapons hurtadas of the stores of the police and those flown directly by officials of the bodies of get of the law . 
the weapons illegal out to the sale since the arsenals military . 
in many arsenals military to often had explosions . 
&apos; there versions seeks of that some fires were damages premeditadamente for cover the lack &apos; , observing a exmilitar . 
according baranets , the manufacturers of weapons also out their part of bit . 
&apos; now have proliferating factories private of weapons that not are competitive in the market international and besides weapons under be to market black , including the of moscow &apos; , says the expert . 
a source more of market black is the smuggling . 
great amount of pistols and machine from of countries poor as kyrgyzstan . 
&apos; there have with their own production , to sometimes non-industrial , and is has set a mafia that has organised the flow of weapons &apos; , explains the former military . 
of where come the weapons ? 
the experts have calculated what is the participation shorter of every a of these sources of supply of weapons illegal to market black . 
a report on this issue was produced in 2011 by the centre of analysis of problems and planning of the management public . 
the specialists carried reports of ministry of internal and of rosstat , bibliografIa criminolOgica and data of access public of blogs whose implore this in about to the weapons . 
the great majority of the weapons illegal , according the researchers , from of the forces armed and of the forces of security . 
the half of the weapons of market black has come there &apos; by fault of officials whose work is related with the weapons &apos; , is says in the report . 
according the researchers , the 17 % of the weapons from of places where there conflicts armed , the 14 % of the cases is monies during the production of weapons and the 5 % is to the &apos; archaeological illegal &apos; . 
the dependent of a of the shops of weapons , that asked that their name not it mentioned , says that the weapons we by excavadores illegal not the buying nobody since ago already much time because are too this . 
more to often , says , the suppliers is encounter to stores military when need a starting . 
to through of some alfErez , the supplier buying a unit , by example a gunpoint tt . 
the laid of registration and the spend by above of the fence . 
&apos; this has the weapon to the city and the sold to 900 eur by unit with two chargers &apos; , we account 
&apos; but , clear , the police this to therefore of all the affairs , so that regular , when there that with the plan of discovery of crimes , out purchases of test to the their of weapons illegal &apos; , adds the dependent . 
&apos; as in a boutique of luxury &apos; 
the must and the one usually found to through of known . 
&apos; visited pages website and blogs to that a kind that i proposed that outside to the platform &apos; begovaya &apos; , where would a man that i would to a &apos; esquinita &apos; where could negotiate . 
of price of weapon , i chairman only there &apos; . 
comentarista military viktor baranets 
&apos; for get a weapon need a friend that have contacts &apos; , says the dependent of the shop . &apos; i a friend so , but not i much in he &apos; . 
in the markets there sellers , but there also is has that come , say &apos; of part of mr ivanovih , that asked that you i that is you had fallen a for to their daughter &apos; . 
even i get a couple of manoplas of steel to through of a person of confidence . 
he also i the except only to me because know that not you i to delatar . 
the job for weapons of different ways . 
the former military viktor baranets is that to test in the role of one of weapons illegal to middle of the years 1990 , when is were to publish a article on this issue . 
the odd , according their words , not have changed . 
you airliner a georgian of photos where not had &apos; of all &apos; . 
&apos; i felt as in a boutique of luxury &apos; , reminds the military . 
to one , according words of baranets , not you offered belies by hare : all what that there is can prove . 
i , as client potential , not only buy ; we with the must to forest , where mouths a white . 
&apos; i give the opportunity of shots and when i emma of that the weapon contribute well , we to negotiate &apos; , describes the procedure the expert . 
shop of bars 
the engines of search website gets to websites and groups of &apos; vkontakte &apos; , where is offers buy weapons &apos; for different involved &apos; . 
for this not is required no document or events personal . 
&apos; is enough have a certain amount of money &apos; , write in the titulo of senior advertising &apos; buy a gunpoint or a decapitated &apos; .

and the people will , as eaten hungry towards the easily , and then , to from coal in siberia 
comentarista military and exmilitar viktor baranets 
i heard about of these systems : by what general , the website website is reported outside of reach of the laws russian . 
the people ago the orders . 
the one for the payment to through of a cash cash . 
&apos; in answer , you research a photograph and the instructions for that will where is hidden the weapon &apos; , mark the secretary of press of the ngos &apos; the right to the weapons &apos; , a.m. kislov . 
viktor baranets says that if is ago a asked in line , one is is without weapon and what mouths in the prison . 
the service federal of security has created a huge network of websites website fake and caught to two hands to those that want buy weapons of ceasefire . 
&apos; and the people will , as eaten hungry towards the easily , and then , to from coal in siberia &apos; , says he . 
makarov by 100 dollars 
in the buying of weapons of ceasefire illegal , according the experts , one is can spend of 100 to 900 dollars . 
according a.m. kislov of the ngos &apos; the right to the weapons &apos; , a gunpoint makarov is can acquire by 100-300 dollars . 
is must wait a month and half . 
is sent since the stores military by the heads of senior half . 
of agreement with the statistics official of ministry , in compared with the period enero-octubre of 2011 , the number total of these crimes in russia is reduced in a 7 % , what that is 22.900 , and the number of cases at of theft and extortion of weapons , weapons , explosives and 85.8 explosives diminished in a 7.8 % . 
is out in strike the employees of restaurants of food fast and supermarkets in us 
to a quarter part of adolescents americans are their first jobs as machines in &apos; mcdonald &apos; &apos;s &apos; 
in the last days , in the states united is has started a wave of protests against the netherlands wages that is paid in the supermarkets of the addresses walmart and in restaurants of the popular chains of food fast , such as &apos; mcdonald &apos; &apos;s &apos; , &apos; burger king &apos; , &apos; taco bell &apos; , &apos; wendy &apos; &apos;s &apos; and &apos; kentucky fried chicken &apos; . 
by now nobody is if to count if will or not this wave to the nine points , or if has aimed lose forces and amansarse in their first stages . 
the actions of protest have with the support of the trade and of a series of ngos of left . 
also of increase of the modest wages consideration by the workers of walmart and the of system of food fast , the aim of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade of workers in these companies . 
by now , this sector of the economy virtually not has been occupied by the movement trade . 
forty and six cents to year ? 
the actions started the week last , after of day of action of thank , the called &apos; friday black &apos; . that day , in states united coomenzaba the orgy of cheap that fished to million of inhabitants , and that to sometimes was accompanied of clashes . 
that day , some workers of the addresses walmart , that as to 2.2 million of people in the world , abandoned their jobs of work and formaron orderly of protest together to the trade and activists of left in the shops of the addresses , whose products is encounter to people of income modest and moderates . 
walmart sold of all , since paNales , control of hunting and batteries for cars , to aspiradores , eggs and milk . 
the products in their shops are of average between a 8 % and a 27 % more cheaper that the of the supermarkets more large . 
is by that that many workers bad paid of walmart buy only in the work . 
the availability and the had of products have fact of walmart a of the corporations more large of america . 
according the words two critical , walmart can afford the luxury of sell products to very under price , in part because paid little to their workers . 
these last also is complain of the poor conditions working , such as the lack of montacargas or naked of hand . 
that &apos; friday black &apos; the participants of the demonstration account the increase of wages and is complained of that the cost of sure of health provided by the addresses happened of 30 to 100 dollars month . 
for a worker typical of walmart , that , 9,5 dollars by time , this expenditure is excessive , said . 
scientists of the university of california in berkeley argue that if walmart increases the wage half to 12 $ by time , this you cost to the addresses 3.2 billion of dollars . 
this is approximately a 1.1 % more of what that spent in wages now . 
if walmart put the increase wage in the shoulders of the consumers , every visit to the shop them will only 46 cents more expensive . 
in a year them will the ridiculous amount of 12,39 dollars more of what that on now . 
the supporters of walmart lot satisfied that the protest had place so only in nine states and that not was no loss to the addresses . 
the &apos; friday black &apos; is prolonged in their shops since the 8 of the later of thursday to the midnight of day next and , during that time , walmart marketed around of 5 articles by second . 
in total , their boxes retailers post-election the &apos; friday black &apos; almost 100 million of transactions . 
the representative of the company , give fogelman , declared in a interview to website website of left huffington post , that was their since of work &apos; least of five &apos; employees of walmart and that the protest not had been more that &apos; another trick of relations public &apos; , organised by the &apos; of workers . 
&apos; box free ! &apos; 
the protests continued this week in new york , in the that the objectives not were precisely the large stores walmart ( that in this progressive city not them have hold , and by that by now not there none ) , but the &apos; mcdonald &apos; &apos;s &apos; and other restaurants cheaper . 
mcdonald &apos; &apos;s says that sold thousands of million of pieces , and then or even you corresponds the low by disease and not you paid by your work honest ! 
jumaane adige , member of council municipal of new york 
currently , of agreement with the law federal and the of new york , the wage minimum is of 7,25 $ by time . 
the restaurants of food fast what will increasing with the time , but only slightly , and of average , the workers ordinary receive in new york 8,90 dollars by time . 
nobody earns least that them in this city . 
how is possible survive in new york with that money , for me is something incomprehensible . 
there a time when almost the quarter part of the adolescents americans experience by the mcdonald &apos; &apos;s and worked there , behind of the departure , to time part-time after of the school , although still living with their parents . 
few were the that pretended this as the main source of income or planearan stay there much time . 
now , constantly tropiezo in some interviews with workers of mcdonald &apos; &apos;s that is complain of that have that live of this wage , and to sometimes even which to their children . 
by another hand , in a forum of the magazine wall street journal there a comment whose author out that is irresponsible have children if not know with what them of feed . 
the participants in the protests , that started to the 6 : 30 of the morning of thursday in the mcdonald &apos; &apos;s of the 40th street and madison avenue , account that to the machines and broth of food fast is them start to pay by what least 15 $ by time , or be , that is them double their wage minimum current . 
also account that in the sector of the food fast is believe trade of workers . 
the law of the us from to the administration restrict this right and punish to the activists of movement trade with tricks and redundancies . 
by other part , rarely time the administration them facilitates the life . 
but , by reasons objective , is easy that the trade abarquen the sector of food rApid . 
a of the main is the excessive rotating of personal . 
discordantes 
ruidosas protests had place that same day in other restaurants cheaper of manhattan . 
the culmination of the action had place to half of rally in the mcdonald &apos; &apos;s it close of times square , in the that took several political democrats local , in particular the member of council municipal of the city jumaane adige , that said : &apos; mcdonald &apos; &apos;s says that is markets thousands of million of pieces , and then or even you is a hospital or you paid by your work honest &apos; . 
the demonstrators received the support of other leading democrats of new york , by example of candidate to mayor of the city bill of blasio , that said that &apos; we support to the workers of sector of food fast for that forgetting receive wages fair and the prosperity economic that is deserves every neoyorkino &apos; . 
as what described the newspaper new york times , this has been the greater demonstration of this kind in the history american of the food fast . 
but in she took only a few hundreds of people , even not all them were employees of service of food fast , in the that trabakan tens of thousands of people of new york . 
still not is clear if this will of lit for cause a movement mass . 
&apos; by now , tricked to brain not is so easy &apos; 
the issue of the reality increase , so popular between the who to the technologies modern , recently is is with as mainly to through of prism of glasses special . 
to beginning of summer , in their conference annual google proved a model in movement and subsequently , in november , is it that microsoft had presented also a request for risk the which patent . 
without however , of a conversation with the head of group of technology interactive 3d in the laboratory of microsoft of cambridge , izadi sharamom , is dilucidO that for the scientists of this company , the glasses already connection to a stage last . 
to them them attracts the perspective of the manipulation of items lot in the air with the hands naked and the creation of areas lot open . 
- by favour , in terms general , what is the subject of study of their group of research ? 
- we we to the interaction persona-ordenador , but also we of expanding the limits of this interaction . 
by now the humanity in their great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the pIxeles of the screen flat , to sometimes the it with the finger . 
but us want look 5-10 years forward and intend the changes scattered in this interaction . 
by example , the computers xbox and the sensors kinect represent a step forward and today in day no xbox is sold without kinect , already that to all them interested the control by gestures . 
- what more we be the future ? 
- to despite of that kinect has taken the interaction to level physical , great part of this still happens in a screen flat , to sometimes in 3d . 
the introduction of information has just ( the system , more data ) , and the exit still not is very good . 
we trying of change this , we in systems of nigh truly tridimensionales , based ​ ​ in different technologies , including the of design . 
is must release the world of the it to our , to physical , do more tangible . 
for this , without however , is necessary recognise not only to user , but also the space that what are . 
then we complete the world real with items lot of a way more comfortable . 
in first place , to considers with these questioners helmets of reality virtual ! 
- what think you on the control by voice ? 
a detail very popular , but not believes that what sobreestiman ? 
- clear that not is you can consider a panacea , is outstanding of resolve the question of privacy , already that not always is want that the others is through of our actions and intentions . 
of fact , all the types of interaction with colleges are good , but every one in their own field . 
by example , for the control of alcohol in places public , we a project in the that we in the gestures , but not in movements loose , but more short . 
also , the gestures were cry not by the house of has , but by a exemptions that 4.5 the movement of the bones and the muscle . 
by now is very large , but in theory can be small to size of a clock of exemptions . 
but , in general , the future is for a kind combined of control , by example of gesture + voice . 
- how is that ? 
- by example , how i would you that you ask this &apos;p&apos;orth of soda ? 
you shall and the bring to same time . 
- normally i only i . 
- oh , that will to be very difficult of recognise . 
- or be , you want force to the users to adapt to what that can or not can do in this time the machine ? 
- not necessarily , but is a harmonization mutual . 
i that in a future next we to have that work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that they determine with precision the reactions of the person . 
these can be , by example , sensors infrared , already that provide a good resolution in depth , what that is very important . 
- if we of their work with the sensors of xbox kinect , what complaints has you of the chambers modern ? 
them lack resolution , depth or something more ? 
- in principle , the generation current is what that can be the start of our work with the recognition tridimensional . 
by course , would good obtain 8 megapIxeles to the at of 1 fps . 
but the question not is in the megapIxeles , but in the quality of the parent and in the depth . 
since this last point of view , all the technologies current not are what enough good for us ; this is more work to the occurred of algoritmos . 
or be , that we that remember not only the resolution in the important x and and , but also in z. 
also is important the at , the number of tables by second . 
the movements human are quite dynamic and the current of 30 fps are truly scarce , on all for the gestures . 
steven bathiche , of our laboratory in redmond , was a 0.40 of contact with retardo ajustable of prosecution of 1 to 100 ms and is mention that the modern sensors produced in series are more close of second value ( 60-100 ) . 
not all the world understand in what measure this affects to the interaction hombre-mAquina . 
to me i would very useful for my work a equivalent of such has , but that not take contact for that the tables by second are more . 
- and not is necessary increase the number of chambers ? 
- the kinect has now three &apos; chambers &apos; , a of the which is of fact the issuer-pays of rays infrared and the second the recipient of the signal has . 
but the third house is in reality a simple 0.40 of diapasOn visible . 
this not is used for determine the depth of subject . 
potentially , more amount of chambers could resolve the problem ... 
or to contrary , increased and fundamental the amount required of are . 
would good create a prove flexible of kinect , around with the cucumbers of location of the chambers and see how this help to determinr the position tridimensional . 
- by what that i i , microsoft , to difference of google , not has presented their glasses to public . 
not you seems that , since the point of view of use daily of technologies of reality increase , the glasses are a of the platforms more we ? 
- by course , through all the pink quo in high a telephone intelligent in the hands , not is very comfortable , but i i : the better option would a reality increase &apos; transmutable &apos; when , in basis of a platform of cloud , you could through of the glasses to telephone intelligent , 
the glasses are alcohol very personal , in that is their force ( the things private only you will see ) , but also their weakness : a reality increase based in glasses not you will work on items lot together with other people . 
- imagine by a time that the manipulation of items hologrAficos lot in the air is available not only for tony stark of the film &apos; iron man &apos; , but also for any simple deadly . 
there a problem in this idea that the critical usually out : not there answer tActil ! 
the hands not feel nothing ! 
what answers indication their group for this challenge ? 
- in my conferences to often i that the reality increase is the seventh just in the interaction between the man and the machine . 
i that the eighth well could be the addition of sensations tActiles . 
while therefore , one of the grist more interesting is the use of the second hand in quality of aid for the image . 
has the you perfectly ! 
but there also technologies that are truly win to they tangibilidad to these &apos; images in the air &apos; . by example , the interference of several rays ultrasOnicos targeted to a point specific where is is the finger is a that similar to the that one feel if someone if soplAndole in the yemas of the if , but that that still is very weak . 
there also pulseras for the cuffing that impact in the terminaciones nerviosas of the if , this also a direction promising . 
- has treaty of tricked to brain ? 
on think that he feel what that seems that should feel in the time in that is something ? 
- that is a good idea , still not what we tried . 
here is behind another challenge with the that will that fight during much time , how do that a person physically within in a space very small creates that will to a space open , almost without end . we working also in the idea of the we of jeopardized ( not as the of the gyms ) , platforms mobile , so as the of the flair giants . 
by now , tricked to brain not is so easy , still there that work during many years . 
that is what that ago attractive the work with the reality virtual for the researchers , that many things is are in a state of total view . 
will personal biased in place of culture - rosbalt.ru 
&apos; rosbalt &apos; continues the project &apos; vanguardismo of st petersburg &apos; , into to the citizens that is are front , to the forefront of art and of the culture . 
in this list of the best is are we figures of art and the scene of st petersburg , whose achievements they more beyond of the city : to often are recognition in europe without that russia the knows even . 
the new hero of &apos; rosbalt &apos; is the extravagante artist kirill miller . 
all the city known to kirill miller , a man barbudo clothing of red of down collapsed , to that is can find close of museum russian , close of garden of summer or in meetings of fashionable and inauguraciones . 
the tables of kirill miller always by to multitudes , where wants that is departure . 
kirill miller is one of these cuentistas purely sociofilOsofos of st petersburg , makers of new mitologIas . 
kirill miller is a brilliant representative of vanguardismo of st petersburg of end of the 80 - principles of the 90 . 
also , is a man urban , whose emergence in the streets of the city meeting in the inhabitants greeted and comments to all the state of mind . 
recently , took in their hands a organillo and is became in the organillero of st petersburg , already that has grown for do so difficult role , by their existence bohemia , their philosophy and their image . 
- kirill , by what you by the city clothing of red and not of hindu or turquesa , by example ? 
- elegI the colour red because am designer of fashionable and i am to the appearance and to the image . 
in this world , the colour red is a compromise between the artist , the makers of images and the society . 
although in the society , all what that not be a little grey for degree and inevitability of properties nothing good . 
but my rabble-rousing are &apos; to that is significant a conversation . 
all the history of my actions provocativas are a invitation to debate . 
- when comprendiste that debIas be artist ? 
- in a explanatory of palacio of culture nevsky , where is actual my jobs . 
i realised account of that that was my way . 
then the wave of old artists not official had over , and the new , free as i , were still incomprendidos . 
i i friend of artists of the new wave , with the subsequent to the that is were in gaza and nevskiy , that was to &apos; pushkinskaya-10 &apos; , and already is over the new wave . 
i sumI in the theatre by the clothes , the music of all the up , but not by the says . 
- and all this is juntO in your clinic of art ... - for me was important certainly in the centre cultural of st petersburg , where is be together the best minds creative . 
in 1995 , previously a territory in pushkinskaya-10 and there , while not had reforms , broad a club artistic musical , a club bohemian , the home of the bohemia of st petersburg . 
many born there : noms , tequila heard , i the way in that schnur brought to project to &apos; the eartag of will bold &apos; . 
schnur and their friends cantaban songs small under fonograma , vestIan got anyway , between them was the currently composer of fashionable angelika vdovin . 
when the group started to play in live , is became in &apos; leningrado &apos; . 
trachtenberg was animador of many programmes before of the times of hali-galivskih . 
them we to trachtenberg and was the start of their great career ; the education basic and training the received of us . 
gallery &apos; d 137 &apos; , the &apos; club griboyedov , are the remains of the clinic of art . 
there would our employees and customers notoriously . 
am a hero of century last , when the culture mean something . 
in the year 2000 , the survey is was in the press , the prize was &apos; the people of our city &apos; . 
in the nomination &apos; artist of year &apos; i elected i , so end my culmination . 
in these new times not is comfortable work ; i am a man to that you like the truth , the honesty and the culture of century last . 
in our times is easy done popular , but the culture and the popularity will separate . one can be popular but very little broad . 
- there in your jobs something recognisable . 
- many of my expect are hits , in them is this clearly the today and the commonplace . 
i to do a explanatory agenda , &apos; the museum russian in buffoons &apos; . 
the buffoons are a category criticism . 
i before was accustoms , but now be so is painful and other . 
but in the buffoons all is embadurna and the tragedy is uen . 
i love what grotesque , i ideas grotesque . 
by example , the &apos;s of world by a change totalitarian and compulsory of clothes . 
now to one what are by the clothes , orientAndose in what external , but not in the internal of the person . 
and , such time to that person not is you should or give the hand , but escupirle in the face . 
and the deception is eliminated when is changes of clothes . 
- ago little you we in the role of organillero urban . - a city culta must have a hero so . 
who better that i for if ! 
- well but , to what better the art trade can be broth ? 
- now the art trade must be careful , fresh , have you . 
we being witnessing of the disintegration of the cultures . 
before the people is agrupaba in 10.5 , the bohemios wanted a thing , the simplones other . 
now all is have divided in microcomunidades , is difficult please to all . 
not am a ticket of hundred dollars for - to all . 
now there that think to who you tass . 
now , every hero of broad has their 100 fan . 
- and for listen to stas mikhailov they by thousands ! 
- will to see the fend , there works the sphere sexo-social . 
and to a event cultural will 300 people , 10 thousand never come . as result , least management , least money , all is marchita . 
i to my fan , what more important is not deceive , not spoil to lose what that olivier achieved . 
when was young was such tables that a coleccionista the tenia communicated in the wall to hand of falk and larionov . 
i started with expect , with the that by what general the people stops . 
now to often who the concepts . 
say culture spiritual , culture of consumption . 
not there no culture in the consumption , that is other history . 
i am a man of the culture of yesterday , crecI under the example of artists that living in the poverty and died in the poverty , is obstruct to money only for paint tables . 
i i to favour of this culture . 
- kirill , what is what that you lack to st petersburg ? 
- good experts in culture . 
there a concept : official of the culture . 
but not all them can who to the culture . 
when the on were the right all was of other way , the on such time not railway very well the culture , but knew that was necessary keep to the experts right . 
in moscow now there very good consultants . 
we people in st petersburg that well could be experts , but are closed , because is need experts to a level higher that nevertheless , to they and them open way . 
now is prosperando the will personal biased . 
what same erarta , but the difference is that them say honestly that not all the art modern is accepted , there some artists that have that seek other museums . 
- what is for you st petersburg ? 
- st petersburg not is a capital cultural . in moscow there very more culture , there there ground . 
but on our stones is difficult that the art &apos;s . 
need ground cultural and we now more writers that readers , this is bad . 
in europe there a lot of people with curious that will to exhibitions and concerts . 
in our case , this class is tiny . 
we that do that the art is of fashionable , as what was to at of century last . 
the project is implemented with a subsidy of st petersburg . 
give to light in the space 
the earth is in danger . 
warming global or clash with a asteroid murderer . 
poorly of losses space with human to board proceed in search of a planet of spare . 
for keep the humanity is ago the question main : how continue the kind in conditions of carrying or in the same planet of spare ? 
i that there little where choose . 
of fact , only two are real milky that can be colonial , to least hipotEticamente . 
&apos; these are venus and mars &apos; , says the researchers head of institute alleged state , sternberg p.k. ( iaes ) , vladimir surdin . 
but if the conditions in mars are best for the life , in the surface of venus the temperature is of 500 degrees . 
only is can live to large altitudes or in the from of venus ... in the space . 
is started to address the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora . 
ago already half century that is were to out experiments with plants . 
four generations of peas cultivados in from not is differed in nothing of the varieties outlaw . 
after wine the rearing of insects in the from , small crack of the fruit , the drosOfilas . 
in 1979 is submitted to space eggs of codorniz for check how is develops the embryo in conditions of carrying . 
helps as result a polluelo normal . 
but then start the problems . 
&apos; the problem is in that this polluelo has that find support , must be on their own feet and start to ! &apos; , explains vladimir sychev , the director of laboratory of institute of problems biomEdicos ( ipbm ) of the academy of sciences of russia . 
to not find support , the polluelos by volteretas to gambling . 
and after of 10 hours in the would babies is was a atrofia total of the shared . 
the polluelos not ecu to the light or to audio . 
and the unfortunately was that to out of four days simply is died . 
&apos; and two sometimes we that born the polluelos , but then what stop because was impossible work there with them &apos; , , observing vladimir sychev on failure of experiment with the polluelos in the space . 
the last time that a &apos; miniarca &apos; biological area to the from was ago 16 years . 
in the spring of 2013 foreseeable the experiments . 
without however , in the biosatElite &apos; bion &apos; only travel species of a same sex . 
there a experiment with asked , that were revised to space already with foetuses . 
in principle , not is found nothing sobrenatural . 
&apos; this was precisely in the biosatElites , but this was a experiment only , and studies as this must be to out &apos; , observing vladimir sychev . 
after of landing , the asked space had offspring . 
without however , still not is has managed address the problem of the reproduction directly in the space . 
is a challenge difficult . 
the animals , to lose their habitat her , simply not can to their backbone sexual . 
the man , without however , to difference of the small animals , in principle , can . 
the homo sapiens has the reasoning abstract and is capable of create a fund emotional appropriate . 
experiments similar not is have to out by reasons ethical . 
but the women travel to space since ago already 50 years . 
the greater risk what happened tereshkova . 
and what more precious that has the humanity is the body female . 
our gaviota fly , and nobody in the earth could say : if is after of a flight to space . 
will or not have a baby after of this flight . 
&apos; after of all , to this question nobody has would &apos; , observing the contractor of sector aerospace vakhtang vachnadze . 
in june of 1964 , only after of a year of flight to space , the first woman cosmonauta , valentina tereshkova , was to light to a daughter . 
the father of the girl , andrian nikolayev , was also cosmonauta . 
in 1988 , the second woman cosmonauta , svetlana savitskaya , who two sometimes was in from and even worked in the space open , had a son . 
without however , the risk still . 
we few , are wall the astronauts to those after of long flights all them has result well , and a generation healthy next growing . 
&apos; and if is can say more , is dangerous even in flights orbitales &apos; , sums the pilot cosmonauta , hero of the union soviet , hero of russia , valery polyakov . 
without however , the humanity must seek some new ways in the biotechnology , in the protection radiation , in the creation of the serious artificial . 
the hidrolaboratorio of centre of preparation of cosmonautas is a stage compulsory in the preparation for the flight . 
in conditions of flotabilidad would , the cosmonautas bars their skills of work in the space . 
the water simula the carrying . 
if for a adult the water is a environment comfortable , although still hostile , for a child would born is their element home . 
the small hombres-anfibio seem confirm that the life in the earth about of ocean . 
there a connection between the fact of that the baby is even approximately 9 months within of their mother in the liquid-fuel amniOtico , therefore you will more easy used then to water . 
in principle , this is logical , because since the time of birth to the time of first bathing spend only 2 weeks . 
&apos; this is very little for forget something &apos; , says aware aksenova , monitora of swimming of would babies . 
in short , if the carrying is a state more natural for a would born , for the women is necessary the gravitaciOn , the force of the serious . 
in the carrying the muscle abdominales and of the pelvis is decrepitan very rapid , the capacity of expulsion of acceptable is reduces . 
good , omitimos that , by in the action of encouraging for the childbirth . 
is can , by course , give to light in a house special , this what empujarA . 
&apos; and then what ? &apos; , valeri polyakov is ago this original question . 
by other part , the child also needs serious artificial . 
without the that of serious , the body not cent the european-wide or the system enter . 
to a would born in from is impossible vestirlo with a suit special for entrenamientos , as to the adults . 
simply is you hunt of what that is vital for he . 
&apos; and this experiment that we to do together , to allow the birth of a child in a environment strange , will place to that traigamos to the earth to a disabled , to a person completely suit &apos; , no the head of committee of bioethics-related of institute of problems biomEdicos of the academy of sciences of russia , angelika pestov . 
by now , the birth of children in the space is a question theoretical . 
without however , with the time this will a reality , when the beings human in their losses is associated to a planet ago that will the home for their children babies in the space . 
head of nkU : the inspection of system &apos; švarc &apos; not has given with the political guilty 
in on of tenders public , the republic czech account with good inspectors and a legislation of quality , although their implementation cojea . 
so what says miloslav kala , vice-president of the office of control by ( nkU ) in a interview for aktuAlně.cz. 
&apos; the law never will perfect &apos; , but their implementation must be right . &apos; this is , in my opinion , what that we lack &apos; , so describes the situation current . 
the controls joint of the inspectors czech and germans also they to conclusions similar . 
as example of a practice wrong , mentions the attitude of petr nečas towards the system of be not only on the role , that is known as the system &apos; švarc &apos; . 
the first minister said recently that the ods ( party democratic civic ) not molestarIa to the employers with inspectors . then , is ban or allowed ? 
&apos; the law must be campaigns of some way and if from something , in that case , or the president of government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls or demand obligations &apos; , complaints kala . 
in the meeting of the commission of control in the congress of the members , ud. spoke of project common between the team czech and the german , in the framework of which is bosnian the legislation which to the tenders public in both countries . 
what is exactly ? 
is is of a control parallel that are to to ago a two years . 
said of way accurate : the legislation european regulariza how is must organise the tenders public , to this you still the legislation existing in every country and , after , the these in yes . 
us what we uk all and , although the control still not has complete , we obtained differences very interesting . generally , the legislation of our country is &apos; more strict and more full &apos; , without however , the these concrete in some parameters is better in germany . 
is confirms , therefore , that not enough with integrate rules every time more stricter , but that is necessary focus in the implementation of the law same . 
what can they of fact this project ? what believes that are the conclusions ? 
precisely a control common of this kind could make to that longer of invest efforts in the closer of the laws , the reduction and the improvement of the limits , although this not have a impact so positive . 
the economy of saving means get a thing appropriate to a price reasonable ( what that not always means that the price be the more under ) for avoid so the enrichment and , to the long , the actions criminal . 
but not by the fact of reduce the limit of the tenders want say that we to this . 
perhaps because the system is saturation with therefore &apos; tape &apos; , that those that want seek failures in the system will do more easily that if the limits is maintained so higher as now . 
ud. about of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the prActicaa of the tenders public . 
how works the system of controls in germany ? 
is a office analogous to our nkU or is appoint of other way ? 
in how to the offices , as the nkU , there acts the bundesrechnungshof ( court federal of accounts ) , with a organisation similar to the our , with a school also , what only is that in their case is structured of a way a therefore different , but in principle both offices evolve parallel . 
also the powers are to true point analOgas , without however , in therefore that germany has a organisation federal , the courts of accounts is are even to this level . in this aspect from slightly of our system . 
the court federal of accounts ( brh ) only can control the money federal , what that here call funds state . 
the funds public , that are administered by the regions and the municipalities , there , in germany , is monitored in the court federal of accounts . 
in as to the legislation local , is more simple that the our ? 
by what general , not i like establish a compared without data specific . not however , germany still being a model in some aspects , but not is can must with what in what is better . 
could be better , by example , in as to the quality of the inspectors ? 
that sure that not , but , repeat , not i like do this kind of comparisons . 
is necessary say that even those countries that we as model must do with to a great number of problems . 
if not outside so , not them contribute no benefit cooperate with our office , not believes ? 
in as to the legislation of our country , what meant for their office the amendment of law on the tenders public ? is world of some way their impact ? 
taking in account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short , still not is has said in the actions of control . 
given that taking controls former post , is be have with a true delay . 
by now , is noticeable in the process of preparation of the controls future : we started a new tool of &apos; detection of risks not economic &apos; , by the that we fact through almost 14 tenders public , that have been considered . the changes is will perfectly reflected here , already that is modify the limits , is rectifican the conditions of some types of process of selection and similar . 
as that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that , more well , is a large for the system bureaucratic ? 
i that this law is surely a step in the direction right and hope that so be . 
the problem that can emerge is that the regulation &apos; is glad &apos; and that be impossible must . 
already with the regulation previous , the people controlled were linked to contractor ( by example , in the case of the programmes operational regional of council regional ) , and every law not respected in on of tenders public mean the violation of the discipline budgetary . 
has sense then tighten the law of this way ? 
i that not of this way . 
the system must from to those that want atacarlo or profit of he and not punish to those that commit a failure formal , that not has impact in the decision-making of decisions . 
a system of this kind only will create a greater pressure bureaucratic . 
and how is its of this ? 
will towards where we has this way started . 
the first minister has declared recently that the ods not molestarIa to the employers with controls of called system švarc , with reference to fact of be not only on the role . what means this ? 
the system švarc &apos; is ban or allowed ? 
the law must be campaigns of some way and , if from something , then or even the first minister of government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls and demand obligations . 
can say : &apos; cambiamos the law and what allowing &apos; , but not can say that we as if nothing . 
in the law on the tenders public , the regulation is quite strict in as to way in that is must act formally . and so is as must be for protect the competition public . 
but , by another hand , is tragic that is excluded to candidate with the better supply by not with the demands formal . 
the law never will perfect , but their implementation must be right . this is , in my opinion , what that we lack .

Šimon ornest : in our concerts want accrue energy positive 
is says that in little least of a month will to come the end of world , what view on this ? 
only is a of between many other news alarmist to the that we like hold . 
to group of music the tap tap we like more well do jokes on this and we like say that we the only group of music of world that manages together enough energy positive for postpone the end of world or for prevent . 
also , in december organizAis a project really original : three concerts against the end of world . 
can explain to our readers ? 
is is of a act beneficial state that have organise since ago two years . 
we decided to take the potential of marketing that has the end of timetable maya wisely for the 21 of december to the 11 : 10 of the morning . 
the day previous , the 20 of december to the 21 hours , co-host 3 concerts aeroplanes in prague , brno and ostrava . 
features approximately to the same time in the that stops the timetable maya in the island kiribati , in the ocean pacific , 12 hours by front of our area explainable . 
to who is you happened this idea ? 
9 was idea my , after were forjando the project all together with our designer honza augusta . 
also of issue together enough energy positive and avoid the end of world , also want think , together with the society , on the state in that we the world to our children . 
with occasion of end of timetable maya also we created a published only of articles : you , t-shirts , meet and original llaveros against the end of world that can advertised in www.e-tap.cz , other way of safely . 
the group the tap tap , together with other interpreters , also sung the called anthem against the end of world , that has by title &apos; end of world , cancelled &apos; . 
currently is very popular in youtube , is will hear in the concerts efforts ? 
clear that yes , and will fair the last , good , always that all from well and not is an the world ... 
the cantarAn all the interpreters to same time in the three concerts . 
the himnos is enlazarAn between yes simultaneously thank to the broadcasting special in direct in the television czech . 
tomAš hanAk has writing the lyrics of this song and amidst the role leading of jesus in the videoclip , where also along xindl x ... 
how about this cooperation ? 
we together even with other personalities of the scene cultural czech , apart of organise many acts efforts and concerts ... 
mouths all our as in participate in this project . 
is has shown that to the majority of them them interested and them divierte work with us . 
to what is will the money youngsters in the concerts against the end of world ? 
to equipment for the centre education without barriers studeo , that have to term in their sixth year running with the partnership civil tap in jedličkův Ustav . 
the at of the school of jedličkův Ustav receive regularly the visit of teachers with the that out activities entertaining and interesting . 
the at not have of media economic enough for pay to the teachers and we a efuerzo for do possible . 
in the framework of the completion of the works in jedličkův Ustav , will a building independent to that we trasladaremos with this project . 
in every aid act several groups and interpreters . 
what are the criteria of selection ? 
tries up a programme that be attractive for all the generations , including the children . 
by example , in prague actuarAn chinaski , support lesbiens , illustratosphere with give bArta , the tap tap , mariAn bango and jiřI suchý . 
for obtain information more detailed , look put www.kpks.cz. 
you measures any other &apos; action witnessed &apos; similar in the future ? 
in may we by first time in the festival pražskE jaro , so that here surely preparing a programme attractive with invited interesting . 
the year that next also we like play in the bohemian national calculating of new york and to me , personally , as that we in states united , i like amplify with actions in washington and in bear . 
vuestros plans in the abroad not are precisely minimalistas , to now you action by example in madrid , brussels , london or moscow . 
the tap tap is , not however , a group set by people with disabilities . 
how is the logistical and the organisation of these travel ? 
not is so difficult how can appear to first view . 
there five member in wheelchair of wheelchair we , the chairs must travel in the operates for luggage and also have much weight , the boxes with the instruments ... 
without however , to now we the we managed well . Čsa and british airways were perfectly prepared , thing that not is of puzzles . 
even in moscow , of where we their ago little , went all without problems . 
thank to the check-in to abroad look for the different attitudes of the society towards the disabled and other aspects . 
with what you you found to now ? 
in madrid , luxembourg , london and other cities , all works better that here ; in russia we been witnessing of that , in the this , is much way by go . 
to difference of prague , moscow is full of barriers , there still without be often that a person is person single by the centre of the city in a wheelchair of wheelchair we . 
something so aware as is , by example , give preference to someone in wheelchair of wheelchair in lift , there not what is . 
by fortunately , is has created a partnership civil that is intensive by tematizar the problems of the people with disabilities . 
in what aspects we take example of countries more progressive ? 
there many aspects in the that we by behind ... 
but is important mention that the as and the improvement of the situation always on of the people to the that affects directly . 
in london and in madrid is very normal that the people with a disabilities serious is person by their account in public and can go to service , to museum , where wants ... 
but not is very common that a great number of people with disabilities obtain in the life social of way active , in this aspect , with the tap tap we a little by front ! 
a society environmentally-friendly or without barriers is a thing , but when comes the time in the that emergence eminent sportsmen , artists , players , political or lawyers , start to change all of truth . 
to now , are cases isolated of people that have a great force of will . 
the group the tap tap is currently very popular , but if at a years back , what you was to be the group in 1998 ? 
there as educador in jedličkův Ustav , where had very people young to my around that wanted who to something . 
and since that i am musician , toco , between other , the saxofOn , fundE a group healthier with a about of work . 
and with the time , as says our counts lAďa angelovič , is we was a little of the hands ( laughter ) . 
without however , the popularity not was to these last years , or i wrong ? 
is truth that we helped quite the fact of connecting with singers famous and also work actively for promote the group . 
we to the conclusion of that the work that not is is , is as if not existed . 
thank to the aid of the union european , we afford also teachers of quality , equipment , etc 
belong intention of come so far with the tap tap ? 
since the principle i the potential that had , that is can do something of another way . 
the world of spectacle is full of things that is seem the a to the other . 
is logical , to their way , all what new is welcomes with caution and long much time in accepted . 
there few things extraordinary , but i dare to say that the tap tap is a of them . 
the impression of someone that we is by first time is clearly the compassion , is a reaction natural ... 
but the compassion is completely superfluous because the people with disabilities not are beings ruins that suffer and of the that we have compassion . 
there people that is capable of live a life full and develop , with the condition , by course , of that will of the media necessary . 
i always i that if something them its well to people with disabilities , then , not is only a progress for them , but for all the society . 
helped the fact of that is ud. a head challenging , as you describes very people ? 
if want do a work of quality , we that be rigorous in many aspects and demand certain discipline . 
i that is completely normal . 
some people they with a vision romantic and with the head in the clouds and when is ever that have that come two days to experimenting , go to the test preparatory and through much time travelling and in concerts , the euphoria initial them or quickly . 
but so is how works in all parties , in every group that want work and get something . 
currently the group the tap tap has twenty member . 
many of them were already in the beginning of year 1998 ? 
only one : lAďa angelovič . 
we a group open , the people enter and its , not is can avoid . 
who have will and wish heart always the doors open 
will the day before of expected end of world , the thursday 20.12.2012 to the 21 hours

poland and the laughing-stock . 
in the meeting of ministers of the countries of the agency space european held the week last is accepted to poland as twelfth member of the that . is the second country member of the that of former bloc of europe of this , after of the republic czech , that is became in member plenary the 12 of november of 2008 ) . 
poland set a intensive cooperation with the that in the year 1994 and during the years subsequent part in the commission of projects of the agency . 
without however , the way of poland towards the laughing-stock began much before . 
the enthusiasts poles already is always to the flights to space before of the second war world , although not always is about their work . 
i , by example , the conference of by Šternfeld in the centre alleged of warsaw in the that , the 6 of december of 1933 , presented their ideas on the study hit &apos; introduction to the cosmonautics &apos; . 
the ideas of young engineering ( born the 1905 ) was to the assistants indifferent and , years after , Šternfeld had that the dr jan gadomski had been the only that had shown interest in their work . 
in the year 1934 Šternfeld successful in france the prize robert esnault-pelterie and andrE louis beautifully by their &apos; introduction to the cosmonautics &apos; . 
the doctor jan gadomski ( 1899 - 1966 ) , mentioned before , is became more later in a great drive of the astronomy and of the cosmonautics . 
published hundreds of articles in weeklies polish and wrote a series of books dedicated to this discipline scientific . 
gadomski is became in a promoter of the cosmonautics , was known in all the world and their contribution to the science is was rewarded when is that their name to one of the crAteres of the face hidden of the moon . 
already in the year 1925 is was in poland a dresina that was to be lay of a engine of rockets . 
unfortunately , is unknown who was the author of the proposal and not is know the destalles of project . 
not is clear if the lift-off was to be used for the cold-start of the dresina or for their while . 
the information on this dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time . 
to from of year 1933 the artillery polish began to who to the rockets . 
the research was funded by the komOrka techniki uzbrojenia in cooperation with the prof . mieczyslawem wolfkem and prof . gustawem mokrzyckiegim . 
to from of material essential , is ago clear that the research was to used of the evidence practices . 
not however , with the arrival of the troops german , is was the research . 
in the year 1937 about in the press specialised the classic of a destroyed of hunting fotoelEctrico designed by the engineering rohoziński and the year next was published the study &apos; rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza &apos; , of author leliwa-krzywoblocki . 
both projects were for to use military of the engines for rockets . 
little before of the war , the committee advisory scientific provisional ( tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy ) is responsible of all the projects of technical of rockets for use military and coordinaba all the jobs . 
the committee was founded in 1937 , but after of two years of activity , is was interrupted by the beginning of the war . 
other studies dedicated to the cosmonautics appeared in the press polish after of the war thank to work of the society polish of astronAutica ( polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne ) . 
in the edition of november of 1954 of the magazine problemy is ago reference by first time to the society with four articles very far-reaching dedicated to the astronAutica . 
in one of them , of prof . gijs subotowicze , is proposed the creation of a society that is devoted to the cosmonautics . 
in that time already is had since in into projects of satellite artificial and was obvious that the research cosmic was a discipline with prospects of future . 
since principles of 1956 the society polish of astronAutica ( pta ) hoped to be part of the federation international of astronAutica ( set in 1951 ) and in autumn of that same year the pta is became in member plenary . 
the year next the first president of the pta , kazimierz zarankiewicz ( 1902 - 1959 ) , happened to be the vice-president of the federation international of astronAutica . 
occupy this office to their death in 1959 . 
to from of 1956 , the pta part of way significantly in the development of lift-off probe rm ( rakieta meteorologiczna ) , that was a success and is became in the first lift-off polish in the that is was to out research scientific . 
the first kind rm-1 was complete in 1957 and is launched by first time the 10 of october of 1958 . 
the lift-off had a on of 1.8 metres , a 80 cm of length and not unable to the 5 kg of weight . 
more later , is end of build the version rm-1a and in summer of 1959 is were the evidence airlines of the rockets rm-2 of two stages in the desert of błędOw . 
the lift-off measured 1.4 metres and pesaba a 11.5 remained 
another kind of lift-off in development was to be subject of study scientific real . the lift-off rm-34 was to have a on of 14,5 km and their mission would control the wind of all . 
without however , in 1962 is dissatisfied the jobs . 
the successor of the first rockets of kind rm was the lift-off meteor-1 , that is was during the years 1962 and 1965 . 
is diseNO as lift-off of two stages , with a length total of 510 cm and a weight initial of 32.5 remained 
is perfectly three types ( called meteor-1a , -1b and -1c ) , that is differed between yes by the space available for the equipment scientists . 
in the lift-off meteor-1a the space available for the volume was of 0.4 litres , in the meteor-1b of 0,34 litres and in the meteor-1c of 0,62 litres . 
the on maximum in the three types was of 37 km 
between the years 1965 and 1968 is developed in the institute air the lift-off meteor-2 , whose first evidence airlines is were in october of 1970 . 
the lift-off meteor-2 had a weight initial of 380 kg and was capable of carry a weight useful of 10 kg to 60 km of all . 
subsequently is was the version meteor-2h and meteor-3 . 
is necessary mention also the entry of poland in the cospar ( openly and space person ) in the year 1960 and the training of committee national of cospar two years after . 
in the framework of programme interkosmos , poland is joined to the research of space cOsmico on satellite artificial soviet and , in the year 1978 , the pilot polish miroslaw hermaszewski is became in the second intercosmonauta after of vladimir remek . 
the from of the law on jobs social not is the solution . 
the week last the brought constitutional suspended the law traabajos social . 
the resolution adherents a prevents discussion in the society . 
since then will interesting at the commission existing since a point of view more broader . 
the systems economic liberals in the eu , as that in the world globalised , is based in the principle of a greater competition economic and least regulation . 
in result , this means that the different forms economic and the systems economic national are in conflict permanent between yes . 
the cause is is in the principle of free trade and of movement free and unlimited of capital private , together with the speculation financial unbridled . 
the effect of the large differences in the cost labour ( of the wages ) is tensions economic . 
under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the that the manufacturer , with the imports of goods cheap , is shorten distances and for this &apos; from a bajadda &apos; of price of competitor with the aim of done with the greater part of market and , of this way , increase their for of profits . 
to great level means , for the majority of the employers , enterprises the production to abroad , buy there more cheap or well as . the result is a unemployment high in those countries in the that the price of work , in compared with other economies , is more high . 
because to that the capital private not has responsibility social any and , with this , not is responsible of unemployment that this phenomenon cent , overall necessarily the expenditure social of state . 
all this situation attacked the total guidance of the employers by pay taxes and compensate the damage economic and social that have caused in their breadth of obtain profits . 
the situation is universally so known that not is necessary it data statisticians specific . 
the practices little escrupulosas of capital private do situations , in certain economies , in the that the governments of these countries is are forced to compete with the aim of reduce artificially the level social of the own population and , of this way , attract capital abroad to country . 
said of other way , the governments out capital private to available of their own population without have in account the decline social . 
this is ago patent on all in the changes of the laws force . 
the aim is force to the population to that accept the dictated of capital private , on all in what that as to the wages . 
this has place , by a part , by the system of duty economic in the case of unemployment of long long-term ; by other , by the right restricted of the employees in as to rights working . 
the result is a poverty growing together with the increase of the differences between poor and rich . 
since ago a series of years , there in germany points of over of food for people poor that not can be with their own work . 
the number of people that receive this kind of aid comes already to million . 
in the framework of increase of the competitiveness of the economy german , is is a case quite often : people employed with a wage so under that the state must pay the rest for come to minimum essential for survive . 
is was public a scandal of this kind related with the situation of the employees additional of parliament federal german . 
the measures of saving of virtually all the states of southern of the eu gets , without place to doubt , to the same situation . the people , pressure by a decline abismal of their level social , is are forced to must as in the century 19th or to malvivir with a wage rotten in the limit of the society , with the hope of that some day comes to country capital investor private . 
is necessary preguntrarse of where next ? 
in the case of that is involved of other countries of the eu , then the poverty is of a country to another or not comes never , since that chinese , indian , brazilian , turks , moroccan , egyptians or african are working by a tiny part of a wage european . 
this also affects to all america latin . 
the bilbao liberals and the media of communication claim to the all that the state not should they capital to the economy , that you the economy leads to their failure . 
the capital private stand with tooth and european the a of that the state not should intervene in the economy entrometiEndose in the control . 
to continuation , is necessary ask if the capital private not part with their egoism in the into policy and , by therefore , in all the state . 
in this case the answer is clearly definite . 
the test is the existence of lobbies , in the practice very powerful and curse , in all the states . 
the result is a situation some that is world in the area of the corruption , in the end mutual , in a legislation that is virtually attitude in all parties but not is criminal . 
in germany the situation is the next : the ministries state , to lack of media financial , at the significant of projects of law to companies legal private , the which are to often linked with the industry . 
this kind of projects of law are adopted after in the bundestag , the parliament german . 
of this way , all the power not from of people , such and as is is in the constitutions of the democracies western , but of the strong groups financial that represent their own interests . 
is obvious that the democracies with a it liberal is who quickly in a situation how the that describes appiAnos in their labour the crisis of the republic roman in times of caesar and pompeya : &apos; the state was time desintegrAndose and the administrations is high-ranking to the force &apos; . 
to change of bribery , end bad ilegItimamente and aid for funding stones or revealed . 
the admissions and the corruption is spread without from one and the people urumqui to the ballot with the vote apalabrado of advance &apos; ... &apos; not had people with nature that aspirara to a since in the administration , so that a time , to cause of this asking , the state was eight months without best-case &apos; ... &apos; began to hears in seriously of that the only no for a situation so serious was the autocracy and that was necessary always a man strong &apos; ... although appiAnos i in pompeya , caesar by to power and taskforce the democracy for always in autocracy . 
the conclusion , of same way that in the old , is that the society current is on in preferences discredit of benefit individual without have in account the interests common . 
the capital private not is capable , in their essence , of understand and risk the profits of all the society . 
the result is the same that the of then , a colonised of the elite without unprecedented , without that is she a effort for them in depth . 
the causes of booming of the regimes fascist and communist must other , by what therefore , in the liberalisation unbridled of the systems economic in the century 19th and 20th . 
with respect to the situation current , is possible consider the disappearance of these systems in benefit of a democracy of kind liberal , as a pause criticise , to the expected of next coup . 
the fact really demoledor is that the elite current ignores by completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives , disasters social and humanitarian of the that we been witnessing , so as the crimes against the humanity , such and as the we in the history former and the more recent . 
the from of the law on tenders public not is the solution ; to least not to long long-term . 
under pressure of the competition economic , therefore to level international as within of the eu , the government of the republic czech is be forced to continue for other ways for reduce the level social of the population . 
this trend is , by what therefore , systemic . 
the solution is by reforms sociopolIticas specific , that strengthen therefore the participation of capital of state as the influence of the citizens in the government and that weaken the position of monopoly of capital private in the society in benefit of state . 
israel : the laboratory of chaos . 
&apos; that nothing comes degradation violence and nothing ever could &apos; ( not from nothing of the violence and nothing could do ) , sting in their song fragile and whose estribillo : &apos; cleanup &apos; &apos;s do not forget how fragile we event &apos; ( not we forget of what fragile that we ) . 
&apos; if my children not want wars , not would no &apos; gutele schnaper , wife of mayer amschel rothschild , in their bed of death in the year 1849 . 
after of the last waves of violence between israel and the strip of gaza , have that , as always , reactions various . 
a , of hand of israel , argues to favour of right of self-defence and encasilla to the palestinians in the because of terrorists . the other supports to the palestinians and allegedly racism by part of state of israel , genocide by against arab palestinians and accordingly to israel of state terrorist . 
not i focus in who is guilty of the massacres that is are regular and who is the victim . to end and to out , the citizens of today in day of israel , including the territories self-employed , born within of the situation policy current and not lived the beginning of the violence . 
my intention is offer to the readers a look behind of curtain , a look for be who out from of the tensions that is prevails since ago 95 years ( calculated to from of the declaration balfour in november of 1917 ) in a small surface of earth of east half . 
some of my considerations is based in facts historical , other in conclusions to the that i come on the basis of my own way of understand the subject , on who or what group of people is the drive main of the events of the history modern . 
in the history of the humanity the history of the struggles by the power is in first class . 
in every time we find a great great or a countess . 
but what that already not is so clear is if always were these individuals the that with their steps of way deliver or if behind of their charles had someone that orientaba their actions towards a particular aim . 
we accept that live in a time that with the wealth of world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this means , not is has been come in a single generation . 
of between these families astronOmicamente richest least a that could be the more prominent ( if still there someone behind , not what know , but not what may ) : the rothschild . 
not is says much to close of them . 
course . 
in the years 90 of century 19th bought the first agency of news ( station ) for that any of with their name with acts criminal of very serious . the power and the wealth , or both , them fees the back , thing that for them always meant a just . 
have cautiously important in almost all the banks central of world and in those countries in the that not are represented , is has declared or is is for a war : before of attack to afghanistan were 7 countries , after of attack of iraq were 5 , after of bring to gaddafi only remained four , but meanwhile russia has counts the bank central to government russian . 
all at that has tried against to this family has died . 
abraham 1861 is refused to renew the state of bank central bank of america of the rothschild , began during the war of 1863 to this money and was murdered in 1861 in the theatre . 
arrar started to this money and wanted decision the system of reserve federal ( states ) and was murdered in 1963 ; the congresista louis mc fadden was poisoned the year 1936 after of issue bring to the states by have outrage the great crisis economic of year 1929 . 
their breadth by the power world them was during the years 1859 - 1871 to maintain a plan with three wars world , designed by the masOn albert pike , caught with the degree 33 . 
the first war is cause as aim eliminate the large states monArquicos in all europe ; the second wanted eliminate the was colonial , especially of great britain , and the third is proposed reduce the population of the earth between half million and thousand million of people ( such amount of slave for their welfare and luxury would and not consumirIan many resources ) , also of the creation of a religion universal ( the ecumenismo not is nothing more that a closely for such solution ) and the adoption final of the powers complete . 
the method with the that operates the group of the families more richest , together with the rothschild , still the dynamic of releasing of crisis and the after offer of a solution ( order ab cao - order to from of chaos ) . 
these solutions are , without however , flawed , and threat always a worsening of the situation . if not , enough remember that the states was created for that not is events a crisis as the of year 1907 . 
so that , after the success of murder of as to charles elicited , which ferdinand , in sarajevo and after of that , to as of this , is development the first war world , apart the russia birthplace with the beginning of the revolution against . 
the first war world over of way kind and unjustified since the point of view military and economic , the capitulation of germany ( the wars for end with the russia birthplace were already unnecessary ) and the after firstly of the great power of europe central , the empire elicited . 
for preparation the ground of the second war world , allowed that the bankers and political created , of way bloodless , a situation sensitive to as of the enormous be of war imposed on germany , with what that is were the conditions a for the radicalisation of the there impoverished . subsequently , them sufficient with them to the germans the solution of fUhrer , that was what enough strong and simple and that to guilty , and build after a czechoslovakia an by several nationalities with a strong minority german that should represent and when so well the role of the fifth spine , that prendiO the out and resulted the outbreak of the war . 
to end of century 19th , the rothschild impulsaron the foundation of movement sionista , a an that hoped to the training of a state jewish , out in the region of the former judea with jerusalem as capital ( return to siOn ) . 
the declaration balfour this before laid the foundations for the immigration mass of jews to palestine and detected the first conflicts with the population arab of place . 
is were attacks terrorists in both parties . 
estallO the second war world : is difficult know if hitler bin too of the be to the that what they control the bankers international in a principle or if all what that was was part of a plan . without however , the suffering of the jews european in the camps of concentration was the conditions a for the acceptance of state jewish in the society world . 
israel was founded officially in 1948 and , of way similar to way in that the be of war imposed to germany emerge the way towards the second war world , with the proclamation of state of israel is was the brink for a third war . 
if the bankers international allowed iniciarla , the nation jewish , to as that in the second war world , is would in victim in first line of combat , now together with the population arab or , generally , muslim of east half . 
israel is a laboratory in , a machine of solder and chaos , not only in the framework of their country , but also to level international . take as example how is into of way resulted the a and opponents of israel . 
who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict israeli-palestinian ? where the injustice gives injustice in a spiral of violence hope , if to beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their breadth by the power world ? 
in this point is necessary distinction between the inhabitants of israel and their authorised , because , to as that is in our country , the bankers international only have to their candidates in the elections . 
the current president of israel b. netanyahu is the typical example of political fascist , marketing to the bankers international , that ago all what possible for should the war to iran and , recital that iran is member of the organisation of cooperation of shanghai ( china , india , russia , pakistan ... ) , working in become in a conflict global and , if we in account that iran controls the close of ormuz , by where is the 20 % of all the oil world ( the corridor of navigation has only two miles of wide ) , would to the destruction of the economy world . 
under what light is show now the words that them david rockefeller in 1994 : &apos; what only that need is a crisis general and the people will of agreement with a new order world . &apos; 
the new order world in their imagination is a world of mr and slave . 
a world in the that the rest of the population serves to a handful of people that form part of the aristocracy financial well accommodated . 
a world in the that to every new individual is you brands a chip to been that controls all their be . 
&apos; and forced to all , small and large , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a mark in the hand right or in the with , to not power buy or sell , to not be that about the name of this monster or the figures of their name . 
is necessary understand : who have two if of with , that follow the numbers of this monster . 
the number mark to the person and this number is seiscientos sixty and six &apos; . 
film argo : if is being oil , have to hollywood 
in november of 1979 a group of the demonstration of students islamists took the embassy american in tehran and took 52 diplomados as hostage . 
their we in freedom was to be to change of destronado shah mohamed rEza pAhlevi , the which after of the revolution fled to merely , country that had patrocinado their regime during decades . 
for the administration american the situation not themselves no perspective positive : bath-water the shah by the be not is what could allow , since that , if what was , were in danger the confidence of their allies in other countries . 
but the we in freedom of the hostage in iran , where the revolution had led in the constitution of regime theocratic , not was to their reach . 
was a coup to prestige of the states united , that subsequently is intensified still more with the attempt failed of release to the hostage by the force . 
the diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after of the intervention negotiating of government of algeria . 
in us , their destination was a wave of solidarity and bear against iran . 
the failure in iran played of way decisive to the defeat of argues argues with reagan reagan in the elections presidential of 1980s . 
the film &apos; argo &apos; of director and actor ben affleck tematiza a episode of this history , that cosechO a small success for america . 
little before of should the embassy , is escaped six employees of building . 
after of a complicated periplo , ended in the residence of the embassy canadian . 
cia , in cooperation with the authorities canadians , managed extract of iran , for this helped a history backdoor a point extravagante : forthcoming with passports canadians , as member of team film that looked the traceability in the country for the making of a excessive of science fiction . 
combination of up 
the plan that bourlanges the expert in &apos; exfiltraciOn &apos; toni mendez be the cooperation of hollywood . 
for that the lie appear divulged , is wrote on the project film in weeklies specialist , is organised conferences of press , the society of production farming had even a clearance real . 
the details on the operation is together in secret during much time , the film is has fact to from of the memories of tony mendez . 
the film of affleck is a combination peculiar of several up . 
by a hand , a thriller political realistic ; by another , a called &apos; caper movie &apos; , the history of a episode that went well , a deception ( a example can be the series ocean &apos; &apos;s low-income ) . 
in the film is combined the states of mind . are by a hand secuencias well it of tehran . in the sequence of appropriations is show photographs flagship of the time of the events , that were plasmados of same way in the film ; not there many differences to this regard . 
by the another , scenes authoritarian of hollywood a therefore more livianas , marked by the irony and a actual excessive . 
and also , scenes of the central of the cia and other institutions : men trajeados that you the situation in the table of negotiations , in the corridors of the office , by telephone ... 
ben affleck has managed restart their career of a way excellent . 
the actor , that had been subject of ridiculed , is has become in a director on and their way of act has longer of be the white of comments appreciates . 
argo is their third largometraje , after of &apos; goodbye small , goodbye &apos; ( 2007 ) and the thriller &apos; the town . city of criminal &apos; ( 2010 ) . 
to same time , is the first film of affleck in the that the action not has place in the city of boston , where is fattened . 
also , the sensitivity of everyone the atmosphere of place was a feature that light to the directors of films old by above of standards of hollywood . 
and affleck what shows in argo , where tehran is &apos; wheel &apos; in canada . 
the best scenes of the film have place in the streets , in the reconstruction of the events got . the sequence introductory of the decision-making of the embassy is impressive by their capacity sinOptica that , to same time , trasmite the ambivalent of confusion and of the lack of foresight that from when , in some place , the history is a step forward . 
affleck and their colleagues obtaining a effect similar in the scenes bungled ( the team impostor in the bazaar of tehran ) . 
too action in many places 
the director had that accept the fact of that a history explained not offers much in the sense film of the scenes more penalised . 
and is the you quite well . to sometimes you adds something to the reality : here not its all of way so elegant ( the scene in that which the crisis in the airport of tehran , the customs of a so-called to america and the search unbridled after their back is become in a madness ) . 
the flaqueza of argo is the havoc that from of the need of show too action in many places . 
alan arkin and john goodman have a role very funny as colleagues of hollywood , although their individuals is deserved more space and not are , or much least , the only in this filme . 
by these reasons , the film of affleck lose a little of rough dramatic , but is a film that is can continue with a interest moderate , appreciate their realisation and the lifestyle retro of a thriller that appealing the years 70 . 
but that is collapse , that will difficult . 
as grand of a history real and as test of what excessive that can be the concepts of omnipresencia and omnisciencia of the services secret , is enough . 
rules for the inflado of flair , bananas and circus 
the servant www.bankovnipoplatky.com , that every year is a survey on the rates bank more absurd , now has decided announced the contest on &apos; the regulation or the ideas more absurd of workshop of the eu &apos; . 
&apos; is we happened after of last event , the eu has to approve a share of 40 by % of women in jobs of direction in the large companies european &apos; , he prAvo bluntly nacher , the organizing of the survey . 
between the absurdidades nominadas is , by example , the recent decision of court european of absent the policies of insurance between men and women . 
to now , the women is aventajaban of best prices in the insurance of life because represent objective a risk less . 
&apos; other ideas beyond of workshop of the eu can be proposals by the people to end of this year &apos; . 
the election will place to end of month of february of 2013 &apos; , informed nacher . 
between the regulations controversial of the eu is , by example , the addition compulsory of biocomponentes to fuel that , as result , harms the half environment ; other ban is the use of the thermometers of mercury of all the life only because contain a small amount of a substance dangerous or the deleted sombre the size of the cages of the hens , that has contributed to increase considerable of price of the eggs this year . 
is has criticised the ban proving of use the expression &apos; butter of it &apos; or the withdrawal of the bill classical of the shops . 
a banana of quality must have a length of 14 centimetres . 
the course of the union decision-making this kind of decisions to often under the pressure of one or another lobby that or industrial , whose petitions in brussels are ideas normally by some state or group of states ( the republic czech , even with the threat of veto , claims the demands of their banks ) . 
the interests of a lobby were behind of the request , by example , of that the bananas of greater quality be have in the eu a length of by what least 14 centimetres and not could it &apos; curvaturas abnormal &apos; . 
the commission european is for saying that with this only search harmonisation the rules national not homogeneizadas to the date , that only complicaban their marketing . 
the rules that do reference to fruit and vegetables in the eu , to despite of the opposition of some states , is have no on the basis of that the directive existing means a waste of grocery . 
the candidate to win the survey could be the requirement of the eu of year last according the which in the flair inflables that is market is compulsory have that the children under of 8 years not are authorised to inflarlos without the supervision of a adult . 
the eu was reference here to a study american according the which , when is about of toys , the flair are the main cause of death child by asphyxia . 
also is existing a restriction similar applies to use of matasuegras by part of children of to 14 years . 
ocurrencias curiosas born even in our country 
also absurd is the regulation which to the officials european : all at that have any role official in the eu not can use the designation of macedonia . for not euphemisms the sensitivity of greece , is must about of fyrom ( pointed pointed pointed of macedonia ) . 
the servant bankovnIpoplatky.com , in cooperation with the partnership of economists liberals laissez faire , nominO in the survey , between some proposals absurd mentioned more down , the requirement of the union on the volume of the has of food in the territory of a state member . 
the eu determinO the volumes were of has of food that can although in the territory of the republic czech the same day of our entry to the eu . 
after , the republic czech estimated , by example , the volume established for setas in retains , what that you an a threat of fined substantial . 
to the organizers of the survey also them was the commonplace of pay to those countries that not have access to sea and the idea of give a subsidy for the request of subsidies . 
this class of ideas not arose in brussels but in prague . 
&apos; we in disadvantage by the fact of not have sea . 
we to the union european a compensation &apos; , declared in autumn of 2004 the then minister of agriculture jaroslav palas ( Čssd ) . 
what alleged with the fact of that in our country is produce much processing and , as result of the so-called purchases of intervention , the state had the stores in and is had that export . 
according palas , given that the republic czech is far of the ports seaports , the eu should pagarnos hundreds of million of eur . 
to end , the commission european is was ready to help to the republic czech and organised a contest public for the buying of processing of the countries that not have access to sea . 
the subsidy for receive a subsidy was proposal to the municipalities by the ministry for the development local at by the minister pavel němec ( us-deu ) . particular , is from to the significant of applications of subsidies of brussels . 
eu : the decided rare are a exception 
the guidelines of the states member are to often white of criticisms , the efforts of the eu in on of regulations and , also , a functioning and development more effective in all the union deserve more well , according several experts , our recognition . 
according the experts , the problem more serious is , by example , the collection of subsidies of the eu for projects that not have nothing that see with the deepening of the integration european , but that the states member have managed in the negotiations on budgets . 
to the czech also them it the very sensitive , of same way that to other countries of the union , the fight by the right to the designation of origin of their products traditional , although our country not always has out well of these pugnas . 
the czech , after six years of disputes with germans and austrian , against with success the designation of origin of requesOn of olomouc , but had that change the name to rum national , whose tradition in our country is back to century 19th , and happened to called &apos; tuzemAk &apos; . 
only the products by-products to from of abroad of cane of sugar can be so-called rum , but not those facts to from of beet of sugar . 
in the consideration official of geographical of origin protected of the eu , together with the cheeses brined and around known in all the world , the mazapAn of the city german lUbeck or the ham of ham , already is are by example the biscuits of bohemian bohemian , the carpa of pohořelice and of třeboň and , even , the variety of hop of Žatec . 
as maras protected of the eu , will be proud of the bread of jengibre of pardubice and the bohemian of hořice greens podkrkonošI . 
the people want that barnabei the republic , but am a amateur , says okamura 
mr senator , how is you happened stand to the elections for president ? 
not is is of be senator or president . 
if in our country outside all well , then not introduce my candidacy . 
but already not i bear see how is monies in the last twenty years in our country , how the criminal are go , is increase the taxes and the age of retirement . 
not had ambitions of be political . 
when see something that not i like , attempt give with a solution for amended . 
and since that already i forty years and my candidacy is independent , the only possibility that i of change the things is coming as senator or president . 
to senate already has come , but little after is has since in way towards the presidency . 
not is giving the on to those people that what have voted ? 
always i that my candidacy to the presidency depended of the results in the elections of senate . 
more later precisE that if and elected senator , introduce my candidacy to the presidency . 
but my aim not is the role ; the role is the tool with the that i do reality my own ideas . 
by that need the greater influence possible and the mandate more strong possible . 
the problem not is only that be a nation that criticize in the bar or front of the television , but that pisoteamos to who that wants an a change . 
to this is you these the media of communication , that you discredit and who the freedom of expression with the freedom of lie . 
of me is says that i sobornado to journalists or that i been advisory of jiřI jiřI . 
we to about of their ideas . 
is is to the fight presidential with a financial and responsibilities criminal of political and the declaration of the property by above of twenty million . 
for this must change the law . 
as president not has this competition and only the senate in their whole can propose laws . 
how want it ? 
as citizen , i set part of a group of pressure for that the profession of guide is should as work not , and what we . 
the problem is in the policy : if someone comes with a good proposal , already be of right or of left , is this to purpose and this affects to the citizens . 
as candidate independent , have of a greater potential for obtain the support of all the groups parliamentary . 
without encasillamientos or dogmas of party , i the capacity of power always something of every party that be better for our country and apply . 
is as more well a man of right or of left ? 
since the point of view czech , i the impression that the people i as more of left . 
for me not has importance , already be a little of left or a little of right . 
what that i care is that emerge forward . 
not i care if someone is of right or of left , i bring to the people . 
always support openly any solution good , regardless of if the proposal next of ksČm or of the ods and , of same way , i in against of the poor ideas . 
ago joke when is says of ud. that is populist . 
but not what is proving with what that says ? 
when is creates a plan business for the company , you also certain objectives and ideals . 
and intentas acercarte to them . 
will those what something populism , but all the proposals of the that i already work in the world or known experts about of them . 
but without the support of parliament only you are slogans . 
and with this not can survive in the policy to long long-term . 
or believes you that if is us to the people and about with them , will , by example , a responsibility criminal and financial ? 
not i other option . 
convince to political , to journalists and to the society civil and try them of my part for this . 
if outside elected president , not would problem in organise a broadcasting in direct by television in the which would to the leaders of the parties parliamentary that legitimaran the responsibility criminal and financial for political , officials , judges and tax of state . 
and , eventually , them should that communicate why not what want . 
if there a like strong that out the disputes , is can do pressure in the scene policy . 
take by case the election direct of president , that has been a achievement of the pressure public . 
to same time i that only am a amateur , not am or a out or a intellectual . 
for my views and ideals attempt seek allies . 
just of start in the policy and attempt obtain the greater support possible for my programme . 
attempt from the things forward i same , but in case of that not from well , within of six years what leave and i to sector private . 
sounds a little as if okamura outside to save the republic czech . 
not am no salvador . 
know that with a person not i nothing , by that i visited to a series of personalities known , by if to what better is animaran to it their candidacy to senate . 
i to see to radim jančura , but is refused because had much work . 
by my part , by what least i supported to the journalist of research jana lorencovA , that his to the light the fraud with cheeses covered of heating . 
i i on of the basis of that the people is really dissatisfied , now i in the balance . 
the sixty by % of the population not turned to the ballot and , those that what did , voted to the representatives of appalling . 
in the senate we two of sector independent . 
the people made the senate , of such way that will complicated achieve changes . 
without however , i banal my own ideas , as by example the election direct of mayors or of governors . 
is recital be their own party ? 
still not what i considered because not i time for this , for check the last unblemished of every one of the potential member of party , or not i money . 
not i money or for the campaign to the presidency , in my account transparent only there 20 billion . 
not has money ? 
about of statements of the property , how is the their ? 
clarification my property private in a 60 million . 
in prague i a ground valued in 25 million , a out valued ten million , another out tasado in eight million , a published of works of art with a value of ten million , a aston martin of a 3.5 million and a Škoda superb valued in a million , and in the account i a couple of million . 
by true , i a aston martin because was my dream of youth . always i pleased james bond , that austrian this car , was galante with the women and , to same time , elites against the maldades and injustices . 
leads a aston martin , their property is valued in 60 million and not has money for the campaign ? 
ud. says that want change the republic but not want to too money of their part . 
not is very convincing . 
not i 15 million for the campaign . 
i that endeudarme ? 
in the campaign already i since 2.5 million . 
the fact of that not have no patrocinador shows that not there too interest in my programme . 
and not i the duty of pay the campaign with money of my pocket . 
the expenses of the campaign cover in essence what that get in concept of salary of senator . 
but not could live of this . by example , not could pay to my son the school english , that costs 30,000 billion month . 
if i only win money , then not i introduce as candidate . 
so that will with their activity business for power live ? 
not has said before that was to stop this activity ? 
this not has nothing that see with a salary greater . 
as i promised , in part i longer my activities . 
by example , the representative of my agency of travel will to be my substitute in spring . 
the people would that outside the samaritano that salvase the republic . 
but i also need live of something . 
how loosen to win monthly as entrepreneur ? 
between 200 and 400 , that i gaining . 
if outside president , then cease the business . 
can put all the interview in the edition of saturday of prAva . 
the study of architecture mvrdv shows that the real adventures not only are in the head - in the example of the library of spijkenisse and the would action &apos; mountain of books &apos; - 2 photos 
&apos; i that the building is fun , has a aspect futurista , and by end there something interesting that see &apos; , says lisette verhaig , a passer-by that is by the street . 
and fUle spermon , technical of you in a great company on close of the library , as : &apos; also , the building is nice &apos; . 
but i i wonder for what need a library today in day . 
all we internet , chlorine and books electronic . 
nobody enter by will in these libraries past of fashionable , not ? 
spijkenisse , a city bedroom on to the doors of arrive that hardly deserves a fugaz visit , holds the questionable honour of have all-in with a record for forget . 
the population of 80 inhabitants is the rate of improved more low of the countries netherlands . 
for counter this situation so scandal , ago some years is decided make of any way to the culture general and preserved the seven bridges fake that officer represented in the notes of euro in way of miniaturas of concrete arm decoradas . 
the success of the for amusing was limited . 
and so was as the responsible political brother that only there a possibility for improve the statistics : had that build a library ! 
winy maas , of study of architecture dutch mvrdv , all a master in the art of the diagramas of bars and responsible of buildings real-life to the couple that &apos;orsay , is took the issue with their her calm and dalmau to the presentation of contest in the year 2003 with five books under the satisfactorily and a questions in the face . 
and while the jury looked oswiecim to their around and is encogIa of shoulders , maas 17,900 to piled the books by size getting a pyramid and brought their soon speech with the following words : &apos; ladies fellow : 
here the you , my proposal for the mountain of books of spijkenisse , the so-called `boekenberg &apos; &apos; . 
nine years after , the mountain of 30 million of eur is comments in the place to . 
this way part of project of revival , that is full with a parking underground , a supermarket , a office of post and a couple of buildings of housing and adosados . 
to principles of november the mountain of books was bronze with the second prize &apos; best library of nl 2012 &apos; . 
also , the project also is nominado to &apos; dutch national wood award 2012 &apos; . 
of this way , the small city i of history , that to the date not had nothing more that offer that a area pedestrian posmoderna and a city incredibly putting after whose façade white one intuirIa more well a central origin , account now with a labour of architecture contemporary . 
but on all , spijkenisse at now of first building cultural public of their history . 
the long way to the book 
the first impression is that is is of a paradise of books under a quesera . 
well is true that there a lift that we hold fair to centre of this around montaNoso , but the real peace-loving of space and the reading not what use , but that prefer fundirse with their topografIa to every step of their escalation to the top . 
the internal completely acristalado is adverts and easy of cover with the view , the soil of brick recocido and the elegant farolas support of way unequivocally the condition public of the library . 
the environment urban is perfect . 
to raise the view is can come to visualizar the banks of park , the dogs and the children and girls playing to football . 
and by all both books , books and more books . 
&apos; normally the shelves of books are willing to what long of the façade and in the centre is opens a huge room brown-skinned that , by what general , often be something asians and impersonal &apos; , says winy maas . 
what that we fact us is to upside down the classical configuration space and from the area of reading of internal to foreign . 
the internal of the mountain is very well tapped : in the half is are the offices , the library of internet , the club of amiable , the centre of education environmental and the room of peacekeeping . 
is special deserve the shelves this that anyone the duties of coating mural , parapeto and barandilla to same time . 
the view , the you and the olfato are meet . 
even the architects and the engineers civil more to day shake the head when necessary about of this material unknown . 
&apos; wanted work with materials recycled &apos; , we explains joop trouborst , head of project in the city of spijkenisse . 
and so is as a day , in a exploitation agricultural frisia , we brings with the animal appropriate from of the agriculture . 
since ago many years , in the greenhouses and in the camps of the countries netherlands is used a fabric plastic of scarce cable of thick as basis for sujetar the roots of the crops . 
is is of a material cheap and efficient . 
this fabric fine hard two stations and after is abandoned . 
for the library this fabric is prensO , by first time in such quantities , to get half of four centimetres of thick . 
with the heat and the pressure , the so-called plastic agricultural ( klp ) time of colour and is becomes in a material dark , border-transcending and durable that of to a mixed of car new and zapatilla of sport . 
after 105 corridor is comes to the top of the mountain . 
to end of this route continual of almost 500 metres around of the mountain we facing the to : since the cafeteria not only is has a fantastic view of the city , but that in she also is can enjoy of a beside croquetas dutch and their ficus acres in enormous flower . 
these do a environment way to the couple that have the content air appropriate for this mountain of literature . 
donations for a new soul 
&apos; although costs believe this their large land glass , this building is a project exemplary in what that as to the ecology &apos; , out trouborst . 
the heating and the cooling necessary is are to from of energy geothermal . 
to despite of that the mountain of books is on under a huge pyramid of glass , even in the days more soleados the sun only ababa during few hours in their internal . 
the enormous cerchas of wood this in sense inter-pillar to the façade of glass serve for give shadow and absorb the majority of the rays of sun . 
this creates a climate internal confortable . 
the rest is thing of the down happen . 
fUle spermon , the own worker of sector of the technologies of the information , already is has courage to to the ordinary in the new library . 
and lisette verhaig also has state there . 
also , the teacher of medicine traditional china cynthia bogarde has visited the library . she described the &apos; boekenberg &apos; as the &apos; soul mention &apos; of spijkenisse . 
the reason is that , with reason of the opening that had place ago a couple of weeks , is invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of their published private . 
of this way is to fill , of time , the missed Opticos of a library that still not account with their for completely ; in the today has 70 copies . 
the concept has sure celebration . 
the shelves are teem . 
&apos; not there nothing worst that a library half empty &apos; , says the architect winy maas . 
&apos; i that thank to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a true link with this building . 
all know that their book way part of the library . 
although only is there for anti-farming . 
of this way , the study mvrdv has managed all a success in that discipline as that in the argot specialises is known as &apos; creation of a identity &apos; . 
the city of spijkenisse has writing a part of the history of the literature . 
regardless of what young and inculta that can be . 
by end a point of starting for shaping their identity . 
szabo : &apos; the germans must play a role more leading &apos; 
germany is has abstained in the vote on the admission of palestine . 
according hosted szabo , expert in the relations us . uu.-europa , this at to berlin in a position diplomatic quite business . 
deutsche welle : to principles of week , germany was to understand that would in against of the proposal of give to the territories palestinians the condition of state observer of the nations un . 
without however , finally berlin is abstained . 
by what ? 
hosted szabo : germany not supports what that the israelis have fact in gaza . 
now well , because to the relationship special that unite to country with israel , germany must have care . 
but to same time i that not supports the position american . 
germany wanted demonstrate their independence without be too criticism with israel . 
during the embargo that had place in libya in march of 2011 , germany also is abstained when of what that is was was of establish a area of ban of flight . 
this has been avowed finally by the nato . 
you is difficult to germany adopt a position clear when are in at subjects international important ? 
yes , so is . 
this is must to that in these at is direction their policy foreign , away of a policy led , by so say , by the states united and focus in a policy foreign german . 
and what that difficult still more the things is that the european not have a policy coherent and uniform . 
by what therefore , the germans is are in a crossroads . 
of them is expected that play a because more independent , but not are used to do . 
i that still are operating what will their role , but already have started the way towards a policy foreign &apos; normal &apos; . 
a policy foreign similar to the countries as france or great britain . 
what means particular a policy foreign &apos; normal &apos; since the point of view german ? 
is a policy that , when is is of interests national , is shows ready to defend clash different to the of states united or their partners european . 
i that the policy foreign german is a strong motivation in the policy economic , is say , in the exports and in their relations with certain regions , as can be russia , china or east next . 
the interests economic germans are to true point different to the of other large powers and by that reason germany must protect their interests . 
these interests economic have affected in the position adopted with regard to conflict in east next and in the vote of the un ? 
by a hand , germany account with large markets in east next , especially in the gulf . 
by this reason must be careful and not alienate of the opinion public arab or not of the Elite arab . 
this is important , by course . 
but i not you would so importance since that not is is of a relationship completely unilateral . 
without however , yes play a role fundamental in the considerations german . 
has attacked germany their relationship with us . added to from of vote in important decisions as in the vote on palestine ? 
i that in europe , and even in states united , the position german degree of a huge degree of understanding . 
by this reason , not i that is has been a break so drastic as in the case of libya . 
perhaps with this germany has achieved inquisitor a true respect . 
to end and to out , all this not has fact but demonstrate that is a country to that take in seriously as actor international and whose interests there that have in account . 
in europe there different views about of the initiative palestine . 
in change , us . added is has shown clearly to favour of a veto . 
there differences of views between us . added and many nations european ? 
always have there these disparities because to the policy internal us . 
i that the government of obama shows in secret a great understanding towards the position european . 
but , to cause of the situation policy that is live here , is clear that the government not can defend in public that position . 
i that the real differences of views not has in reality the grateful that is you attaches . 
if we the relations between obama and the first minister israeli netanyahu , see that obama not is for nothing happy with the policy that develops . 
you is difficult to germany reconcile the links relations that maintained with israel and states united , by a hand , with the position of their main partners in the eu , by another ? 
i that is precisely that what that ago that be so difficult for the germans . 
by course that would a little more easy for the germans if existed a policy european coherent and access , but not is the case . 
by what therefore , not have the possibility of be part of a broadcasting higher , but that must promote the things since their own position . 
that is precisely what that are doing now with the euro . 
i that in the future germany will a role of leadership to the time of force to europe to adopt a position european . 
by course that this not is nothing easy for germany , already be simply by the relationship that maintained with israel . 
this has been always a issue handles . 
but i that the germans have clear that must play the role of on independent . 
is is germany to yes same in the role of actor international important ? to in reality germany taking a role leading ? 
or perhaps you still break difficult accept that leadership ? 
germany still not is has have , always is something you and , by reasons obvious , to country you still collapse play a role more important . 
if we the crisis of euro , by example , see that every time that germany is an as actor main , is when certain feelings antialemanes . 
this not is easy for the germans . 
is is of a old problem and is that nobody want be surrounded of the countries enemies . 
seen of this way , germany is is in a position much more difficult that states united . 
must show a attitude inclusive with to the different neighbours and views and that not is easy . 
the influence of us . added in the policy european ever every time more , but the eu not cover of time that we , who is then ? 
to the germans not them will more no that taking a role more leading . 
even if not them like , if them is unpleasant or if them becomes in a people still more unpopular , c &apos; &apos;est the vie ! 
hosted szabo is director executive of the academy transatlantic in washington , a institution in the that academic and experts in policy from of europe and of america of north you of way joint the challenges to the that is faces the community transatlantic . 
szabo is also member of polls marshall fund , where is has specialises in policy german , policy foreign us and relations transatlantic . 
&apos; protection of trademark &apos; in china : when puma and around is become of suddenly in trademark chinese 
around is a mark known to level world and marco ralph lauren also . 
but , what is around marco ? 
after this name is behind a designation eu officially in china but that not has nothing that see with the companies original . 
not however , this degree of protection while the real epOnimos not be a demand . 
and even then not is clear that is them will to give the reason . 
&apos; to the foreign them is every time more difficult protect their trademark in china &apos; , out greek pattloch , lawyer of bufete incumbent wessing specialises in violations of rights of protection in extreme east . 
every week comes to my table a new case . 
the imitators simply in a couple of says for power ! their trademark . 
of this way , gucci is becomes in lu-gucci and in place of prada is has prada-kny . 
the companies german also is copied legally of the same way , such and as you has happened to manufacturer of articles sport puma . 
pattloch opens a cupboard in the that have seats of the office of trademark of beijing . 
the 14 of september of 2010 a company china was ! the mark zegna df puma , a name artificial that also is useless of the home of fashionable ermenegildo zegna . 
that the chinese are champions world in that of preserved and of all the rights of property intellectual is of much known . 
in the large cities there large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting . 
without however , the cases of pattloch are of other a . by charge of their customers , he fight against the fact of that the office of trademark granted of way official to the companies chinese the right to from from of a designation that already is eu in another place . 
the chinese what refer &apos; bang ming pai &apos; or mark allowance . 
the word has their origin in the term chinese &apos; bang dakuan &apos; , 
that ago reference to women that have &apos; fish &apos; to a man puerto . 
the authorities chinese not is feel guilty 
&apos; is harmful for the business , there that fight against this &apos; , requires pattloch . 
&apos; the mark ago waters , the position 70s disappears and the damage that suffering the image is huge . &apos; 
the losses financial and the coast procedural of the sectors affected are millonarias , on all in the case of products flagship of luxury . 
according data of the company of analysis of market clsa , with a volume of 15 million of eur to year china is , in size , the third market of articles of luxury and the that overall to greater pace . 
without however , achieve the acts of enrolment of doubtful legality in the registration of trademark is complicated and also is much money . 
the processes is can over to nine years and the result is uncertain . 
pattloch about of cases in the that the court rejected a demand because had appropriations therefore time that the name subject of the demand already is had become in a &apos; reality of market &apos; . 
&apos; if the they has bad fortunately , perhaps even have that pay money to plagiador because the process has damage to the mark of this in china &apos; , out pattloch . 
in times this is the law of the jungle . 
some of the cases more known have that see with elements graphic . 
in 2009 daimler-benz lost a greek against the manufacturer of machinery of construction sany , the company that has been taken ago little by the manufacturer german of bombs of concrete putzmeister . 
by that to day of today the chinese can continue being a emblem very similar to the star of mercedes . 
the one of corresponds , geely , dispense to principle a logo in white and blue that had in great measure to bmw ; the subject is dirimiO in the courts and geely had that amend . 
the manufacturer of clothes lacoste lost in china against imitators from of hong hong and singapore whose logo represented a crocodile eye in the direction opposite to original . 
the authorities chinese not is feel guilty . 
the office of trademark ctmo in beijing recognised that in 2010 have had difficulties because to the shortage of equipment and funding of personal . 
the year last , without however , &apos; the situation of emergency labour came to the as &apos; . 
of this way , the amount of processes of complaint without tramitar is has small in a 22 % . 
almost 57.000 of these cases is properly been , a 75 % more that the year previous . 
without however , 81.500 complaints are outstanding of resolution . 
fight against this costs much money 
as often be her in china , the figures are surprising . 
the year last the ctmo registered more of 1.4 million of applications of protection of trademark , almost a third more that in 2010 . 
is would of a new record and means that china lidera by tenth year running the list of new enrolment in all the world , according out the office of trademark . 
seems that this also happens with the number of balls valid , figure that out to 5.5 million in total . 
in 2011 is would embolsado 1.8 million of cny in concept of rights . 
said of other way , this means that of average every register costs 1.280 cny or 160 eur . 
fight against this costs much money , such and as shows the case of the company family german freudenberg . 
since ago more of seven years the group fight in the courts against a imitador chinese . 
if well the germans have managed stop the manufacture illegal of parts of car of imitation , 
the imitador has achieved ensure the rights chinese on the mark freudenberg . 
&apos; us ourselves we caused this situation because in germany the surnames not are protected &apos; , out hanno wentzler , president and consejero delegado of freudenberg chemical specialities in munich . 
the office of trademark ctmo also rejected the appeal of the muniqueses . 
in the two following bodies you have given the reason to freudenberg , but the part opposite still fronts in the today . 
there that have great care 
now the case has come to the doors of court higher of justice , where still outstanding of resolution . 
wentzler responding in power resolve welcome the question and extolls the professionalism of the courts . 
without however , also says that &apos; the procedure is extremely expensive , therefore in terms of money as of time &apos; . 
is difficult estimate the costs internal ; the for business has had that review brought of to hundred years of old for power they evidence . 
ago five years freudenberg promised to the part opposite a &apos; sum of six figures in eur &apos; with the aim of come to a agreement friendly , but not had success . 
&apos; this shows what much that we care &apos; , out wentzler . 
the dangers that across in extreme east threat even with affect to europe , 
particular if the imitators is they there the rights on trademark not protected . 
so , a manufacturer chinese tried ! in germany the name freudenberg for shoes and products of fur . 
ago time that the group came this area trade , not however not prevent the register . 
&apos; there that have great care &apos; , says wentzler . 
therefore he as the lawyer pattloch around to the companies german that are extremely careful to the time of do business with china . 
not enough with rely in the legislation international on rights of mark , but that what that there that do is &apos; ! also in china all what that can be for of protection &apos; , such and as as wentzler . 
of what contrary , the issue can be much more expensive that a simple registration . 
of fact , in case of that freudenberg avoid the last assault of their battle particular , then would that pay to the part opposite rights of licence by their own name , such and as explains wentzler . 
that or in the segment in question we expulsarIan of market . 
day world of the fight against the aids : dance , announces , help 
in ag approach the chorus imbongi and in swaziland is delighted the orphans of aids 
the history of a link capable of that overcome much more of 8.733 kilometres of distance .

in swaziland there 245.000 orphans of aids . 
more of 40 % of the population already is positive . 
the partnership voices and africa has found in germany godparents for the u-turn orphans of aids of people of esitjeni . 
seventy of them attend to the school secondary . 
by 15 or 20 eur to month is can apadrinar to a child . 
this contribution will the stops of the school , the uniform and you will a food a to day in the gogo trade . 
imbongi means in zulU &apos; narrador of stories &apos; or &apos; panegirista &apos; . 
in this room nobody know about with concrete this language bantU , but announces yes know . 
since ago ten years this chorus approach songs in this &apos;softly language foreign that in times there transportarles to their place of origin : the southern of africa . 
to 8.733 kilometres of distance in line straight since ag , in the north-east of kingdom of swaziland , there a people called esitjeni that on of the voices of this chorus german . 
the forty by % is infected 
approximately 2 people live there , some still in opportunity ravines of and and disease , a great part of them are children . 
more of 300 already not have parents because have succumbed to aids . 
esitjeni is a small example of what that affects to swaziland : the rate of infection of aids more high and the hopes of life more lowest of all the world , according unicef . 
the population not is with good eyes the circumcision , a practice that according is has shown reduces to the half the risk of infection . 
more of 40 % of the inhabitants of swaziland are carriers of virus of the line , and die with something more of thirty years is has become in something her . 
during a journey whole to africa in the spring of 2005 the chorus found this recOndita population , but what that were on all were many children in the streets that which not only of the protection of their parents , but of what main : food , clothes and training . 
without title school , the possibilities in a country poor are more that 6 . 
in a principle was only the compromise particular of a few what that was possible that a child outside to school and disfrutara of a food a to day . all this by a few eur . 
without however , a year after the chorus 60 the partnership &apos; voices and africa &apos; that since then is has occupied profesionalmente of the orphans of aids in esitjeni . 
facts on the infections of transmission sexual 
what are the main diseases of transmission sexual ? 
between the incidence of origin bacteriano are the identifying , the chlamydia and the gonorrea . 
the incidence of origin vIrico more arise are the aids , the virus of papilloma human , the herpes debated or the hepatitis . 
the ladillas and the sarna is are between the incidence airborne by parasites . 
what are the main groups of affected ? 
the identifying and the gonorrea is give with more often in men that have relations sexual with other men . 
the institute robert koch part of the basis of that to least four of every five cases of identifying registered in germany have their origin in a contact sexual between men . 
in the case of the adults heterosexuales the diseases of transmission sexual more arise are the infections by chlamydia , tricomonas , the virus of papilloma human , the candidiasis ( hongo ) and the gonorrea . 
the infection of hiv between the adults heterosexuales of country is relatively small ; not however , approximately the 20 % of the new infections by hiv is are in this group . 
between the young , the infections by chlamydia are much more arise that in other groups of population . 
according surveys european , three quarters of all the infections affect to young of between 15 and 25 years . 
in our country , the virus of papilloma human also is adds to the diseases more arise between the youth . 
how has out the number of infections ? 
not all the diseases of transmission sexual are subject to declaration compulsory . 
according the institute robert koch , the number of infections by identifying has doubled their figure of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011 . 
the number of new infections by hiv maintained a trend downward since 2007 . 
in 2011 is crimes approximately 2.7 cases . 
is is of a tenth part least that in the year previous . 
what symptoms show that is is of a disease venErea ? 
the diseases infectious can cause Ulceras in the area debated , bother to orinar , flow , pain abdominal , so as ampollas or verrugas . 
to often not cause pain or cause other symptoms and by that not is we . 
how is can one protect ? 
the condoms can reduce the risk of infection , but not offered protection to hundred by hundred . 
some players diarrhoea of diseases of transmission sexual also can stated to through of infections by suciedad and by contact physical . 
by this reason , the experts around discussed regularly to examinations doctors , on all if is time with often of couple sexual . 
if is diagnosed of way early , the majority of the incidence can cured and is possible avoid any result mention . 
to through of / , donations and , by last but not by this least important , of the disciplined that price the chorus by their actions in all germany , they to custom quite money . 
&apos; in total we sent already a 200 eur to esitjeni &apos; , out proud annette lennartz , president of the partnership . 
in the own people zodwa dlamini a woman safe of yes same and with low of leadership administers the money sent since germany . 
is as of that the orphans who a good cholera , by example with a of the grandmothers . 
the &apos; gogos &apos; , as is shape to the women elderly in zulU , are the pillars of people . 
some of them have to 14 orphans to their office , them offered a homeless where live and is are of that the children matured to the school all the days it and orange-coloured with their uniform . 
the that not have to nobody are under the protection of khanyisile , a woman accounts that , to as that the two cocineras that is at of cooking all the days for more of 200 children hungry , is a wage of the partnership . 
also , &apos; voices of africa &apos; has since in into a school of remnant , has built two gallineros and , in cooperation with the organisation health us psi , has achieved that many of the inhabitants of people is have subject to a test of hiv . 
this not is something obvious , since that , to despite of what patent that is this disease in all the country , not is often about openly of she . 
a king with 14 wives 
&apos; the aids is a taboo all &apos; , says annette lennartz , &apos; because has that see with the acceptance &apos; . 
something strange in a country in the that the king has officially 14 wives . 
the last monarca all of africa black , the king mswati iii , is known by their lifestyle of life opulento and full of careful . 
poligamia in place of democracy . 
this way of life not found officially is in great part responsible of the spread so fast that has experienced the virus of hiv in the last decades . 
but also is must to the countless temporeros that only the country of a hand to another and that what have beyond where will . 
according annette lennartz , &apos; in any corner is can get condoms free , but these hardly is use . 
is other culture , here only accepted the contact fur against fur &apos; . 
for promote the exchange cultural , the chorus imbongi travel every two or three years by the southern of africa cantando songs that about of gloom , spirit combativo , hope and confidence in the race black , songs that many in the extreme more south of continent african still reminiscent of the time of apartheid . 
a bus full of white that speak songs in a language of black ; therefore recognition not only brings for a excellent environment and very joy , but that also has achieved arrancarle a couple of tears to some that another soldier border rabioso . 
the journey them has always to esitjeni , where the singers visiting to the children apadrinados . 
to despite of that this small population hardly though in the maps , in the valley of river ezulweni is very known . 
&apos; acErcate to esitjeni , there ababa the light &apos; , says the people of place . 
and after go the 8.733 kilometres in line straight of back to ag to the rooms of trial of the street bergheimer teem of singers pointing the step , one is is account of that also is possible see brillar their light since there . 
messenger : the nasa which ice in mercury 
the probe messenger has found evidence of the existence of ice in mercury . 
probably the layer of ice have a thick of to 20 metres . 
the nasa , the agency space american , has great evidence of the existence of ice in mercury . 
to despite of be of planet more near to sun , there also there water helada , such and as is from of three studies published the thursday in the magazine specialised &apos; bamst &apos; . 
the probe messenger would found evidence of that in the area of planet that is is constantly to the shadow is has set a layer of ice . 
seems that this has to least 30 centimetres and probably even to 20 metres of thick . 
the water from possesses of cometas or , with great likelihood , of asteroides that in their day collisions against mercury . 
nobody linked the headlines of ice with the possibility of that there life in the planet , says the researchers head of the probe messenger , are solomon . 
the temperature in mercury can achieve to 426 degrees degree . 
without however , the findings could help to britons how have come the water and other components of the life to other areas of system solar .

in this logistical is is the group of stars young more we of our way milky . 
this area of training estelar is constantly new stars . 
in this cloud of stars , associated to the logistical roseta , also arise continually new star ; to 5 years light of the earth . 
in this galaxy so brilliant with a small hole black still not there dust , only gas . 
the researchers excessive that is formed little after of bang bang , when in the universe is could find on all hydrogen . 
our window to universe : the telescopios more important 
seems that the telescope was invented by hans lipperhey in 1608 , before of that galileo galilei what green a year after for observed the stars . 
since then , the energy-producing of the telescopios Opticos not has unemployed of grow and the images that we offered have every time more depth . 
during 30 years , particular of 1947 to 1975 , the telescope hale it in the centre palomar close of st diego was the more large of world . 
their mirror , in the image , had a diameter of five metres . 
in arizona , us . which . , is comments the present binocular telescope . 
this allows observed the laughing-stock to through of two energy-producing , every one with a diameter of 8.4 metres . 
the internal of great telescope canary it in the island of the palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10,4 metres . 
the mirror of drawn drawn present telescope in south is segmentado for save costs . 
despite to this , than a diameter of approximately eleven metres . 
the these of this construction more economic is that the telescope has a angle of raising fixed , by what that their mobility is limited . 
the telescope hobby-eberly in alaska also has a angle of raising fixed . 
their particularidad is their huge capacity for up light . 
to despite of have with a diameter of mirror comparison more small , this capacity is surely to the of the telescopios of mirror more large of world . 
with aid of lofar of arecibo ( port puerto ) the researchers can explore the universe in search of signals of life extraterrestre . 
the lofar has a diameter of 305 metres . 
in the &apos; search of intelligence extraterrestre &apos; ( seti by their driver in english ) can help any person that legally a computer , bringing capacity of prosecution . 
view of centre european southern ( that ) it in the altogether chilean . 
here is comments the very present telescope , a telescope that ago honour to their name . 
with a total of four energy-producing , this telescope also can iluminar the spectrum infrarrojo half . 
the that also suggestions the so-called e-elt ( european extremely present telescope or telescope european extremely large ) . 
their mirror maintenance will 42 metres and will up by a total of 000 elements reflectantes . 
to 2018 not is expected power take images . 
to 2007 the two telescopios keck located in the volcano hawaiano of mauna kea were who the more large of world . 
these have with two energy-producing , every one of them with a diameter of 10 metres . 
the telescopios keck form part of centre mauna kea , that together to them explora the sky with the aid of telescope subaru and the irttf . 
in mauna kea is to build a new telescope of enormous scale and with a diameter of mirror of thirty metres . 
this is a image of how would . 
without however , the information more important of laughing-stock we comes of the hand of telescope space hubble . 
since the 24 of april of 1990 middle images of worlds distant . 
since march of 2009 the telescope space kepler search milky extrasolares , mainly those that are liveable . 
the 2 of february of 2011 the nasa announced that since the beginning of their mission is had localised 1.235 candidates to milky . 
in the image is are the last preparations very to launching of telescope space kepler . 
the telescope james webb space telescope ( jwst ) not is launched to space to board of a lift-off ariane 5 to 2018 . 
the mirror maintenance of this telescope space has a diameter of 6.5 metres . 
a of the duties of this telescope will seek the light of the first stars and star cases after the bang bang . 
the researchers proceed of the basis of that in the marco southern of mercury also there ice . 
without however , not there evidence legally , since that the probe messenger this in about to planet in a from much more their to marco north . 
since ago decades the measurements of lighting invite to the existence of ice in mercury . 
thank to the probe messenger ( 2004 ) , the first that 17th in about to mercury , now the scientists have the certainty of that is so .

a search of fingerprinting in a country in the that the people of 97 years still are considered young . 
the way by the region mountainous of talysh could altogether of with and romantic . 
the minibUs is with great din to through of the sinuosa road that is to hand of bangladeshi boscosas , rivers of great wealth and of the opportunity houses of the farmers local . 
all is green and juicy , one could even think that is is in the jungle black . 
without however , we are in the area more south of azerbaijan ; since here the border with iran is is to so only a kilometres . 
here live the &apos; talyshi &apos; , a people of that not is know much , apart of that dominated perfectly the counter and the azerI and that are very ageing . 
our destination end is lerik . 
this small city defeating of a architecture perhaps too maciza designed in the was soviet and that not seems dovetailed of all in a landscape montaNoso so attitudes . 
the tourists european hardly they to this place , already that the way since the capital of azerbaijan , baku , is too heavy . 
for go the 323 kilometres that separate both numbers urban , is need eight hours because the road is of a only sense . 
the astonishing wealth of the that degree the country thank to oil of sea caspian still not has come to this recOndita region . 
without however , pilata fatulayeva ( 48 ) is convinced of that lerik has what that there that have for become in a tourist tourist . 
&apos; baku is was famous in may with reason of the since of festival of song and the next year we the festival of the people more elderly of world &apos; , out fatulayeva . 
is is of the director of museum of the longevity , perhaps the only that there in the world . 
here is detailed the life of eight dozens of talyshis of place that have have the 100 years of age . fatulayeva out a image in white and black . 
this is my grandfather , that lived 120 years . 
a son own died to the age of 136 years 
without however , the star its of museum is the herding of sheep Şirali mUslUmov , that seems have through 168 years . 
not however , not there no starting of birth that what certifique . 
and if we in account that the man of greater age detailed lived 122 years , seems that the age of mUslUmov is quite fine . 
&apos; born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973 &apos; , we explains fatulayeva . 
the man was got in three times and had 23 children . to appear still had time of conceive a daughter more to the age of 136 years . 
is has wrong then Şirali mUslUmov in their age in a couple of decades ? 
without however , rembrandt scholz , gerontOlogo in the institute charisma planck of door , also has heard about of the elderly age of this head of asia central . 
&apos; in some regions of china , japan or in the valley of hunza in pakistan also live people of age very elderly &apos; , says scholz , &apos; even in sardinia there many men elderly &apos; . 
because to the lack of background , is impossible they evidence scientific about of the age ; very when not there no registration civil . 
all the days vasos in of butter derretida 
is a fact that , of way surprisingly often , the inhabitants of the region on in about to lerik usually achieve a age biblical . 
in the today there 20 people that campaigning the 100 years of age . 
by what live here , in the southern , many people of age elderly ? 
the guide housing azerI farid mugimzadeh explains that is is of the genes special of the talyshis . 
the director of museum , the mrs fatulayeva , believes in change that the cause lies in the food . 
without however , since a point of view nutritional , not seems logical that precisely the food rich in lowcalorie of the talyshi , that adoran the meat , the bread and on all the products dairy and many of the which , also , drink daily a glass of butter derretida , be so healthy . 
or perhaps be the way of life natural the that maintained to the people young ? in cengemiran , a small settlement not far of the city of lerik live rubaba mirzayeva . 
to their 97 years is relatively young for what that is estila by these latitudes . 
mirzayeva , that says have 143 backed , live in a simple home of wood typical of all the region of caucasus . 
ages in the soil , all of way unstinting a huge tina of butter . 
eight people live under a homeless , between them one of the children and a daughter of mirzayeva , both is became in grandparents ago time . 
also brincan of a hand to another two children small . 
in the kitchen prepare added for the invited , a added that serve in a vasos classic with way abombada . 
the european of mirzayeva are white and are perfectly laid and under the headscarf behind two we trenzas of hair smaller dark that their son we which proud . 
always i i laundering the hair with milk , by that never is i has fallen and has had their colour . 
&apos; not i used never a chemically &apos; , says mirzayeva . 
the pension is enough for live 
of always has – only what that produce in their own farm : 6 , potatoes and peas . 
in all my life not i gone never to do the buying to a supermarket . 
then we about of their husband , that was in the army . 
what worst was the time after to the second war world . 
without however , all came to their put when the &apos; wanted father &apos; , heydar aliyew , took the control of the situation . 
this kind of propaganda sounds rare in their of a woman greater . 
without however , in azerbaijan the broad that is building to the on colorado of the nation , that us their country as a dictator , not known limits . 
this is remained in the power to 2003 , time in the that gave the witnessed to their son aliev . 
to least the people elderly of azerbaijan not know what that is the poverty . 
mirzayeva price 230 manat ( approximately the same amount in eur ) in concept of pension monthly , a amount with the that is can live well taking in account the situation here . 
and perhaps the canoso son of mirzayeva have reason : &apos; in our culture the elderly are very respected &apos; . 
live in a great family , are amados , receive all the care necessary and are happy . 
as if this not outside reason enough for be with life many years ... 
in the constitution lack the expression &apos; rights human &apos; 
the revolution has their to cairo . 
demonstrations that conclude between yes in the cairo out of clear the exaggerated division in the that is desperately the country . 
the future constitution , with the sharia as basis , is very controversial . 
the president egyptian not indulge in eschew . 
&apos; we overcome the transition . 
and that that happen is my responsibility , to the people and to god &apos; , stated in the television public . 
their speech was at to all the people , on all to the coptic christians , the liberals , the muslims alexandra and the secular . 
all them , become without no to now in a confused opposition , have fear . 
fear of a theocracy to on of disputed by the grace of the powerful community muslim . 
such and as explains followed mursi , almost asking forgiveness , has had that down of way temporary the powers of court constitutional and expanding the you &apos; for power save the revolution &apos; . 
without however , or the egyptians or the world whole know very well what that this engineering of 61 years with a title of phd orientates by the university of southern of california want save really . 
to deprived of their power to the judiciary ? 
of fact , the 234 articles , whose adoption has been forced by a house assembly an by 100 member overwhelmingly islamists in a meeting quality of 15 hours of long-term , are truly worrying . 
as in previous constitutions , in the draft also is says that the justice is on in the &apos; principles of right islamic &apos; . 
without however , what means that of &apos; principles &apos; ? 
this was and still be open to the interpretation and seems that the islamists will to take this vague wording , so as the for of manoeuvre legal that has honour , for impose a interpretation more strict of the sharia . 
this is to least what that suggests a new article added : in all the issues relating to the sharia is compulsory put to the university al-ashar , the institution islamic more important of country with a great power in all the an sunni . 
not has by what be so , but this can mean that the clergy monitored the legislation , something that - of fact - would as result the incapacity of the judiciary . 
great part of draft of the constitution is open to the interpretation 
what that also is problem is that to keep the jurisdiction military . 
during the dictatorship of mubarak these courts fallacious for exercise a hard repression on the opposition . 
after the caves of dictator to 11 civil is who detained in prisons military . 
such and as for the draft , the state has of protect &apos; the real essence of the family egyptian &apos; and &apos; promote their moral and their values &apos; . 
is is of a wording so imprecise in terms legal that with the aid of this article the institutions state could even control the content of the arts and the literature . 
talking clear not is is of other thing that of censure . 
by true that no article for of way explicitly the equality between men and women . 
in change another from offend or punished to upon followed and to their legacies . 
without however , not is clear what is a &apos;s and how has of be sanctioned . 
as of doubtful is the wording that from the &apos; &apos;s to the people &apos; 
is enough a caricature of president or a joke on a letrado ? 
question of interpretation , as many other things in the draft that has been presented to mursi for their signing and that according , their words , &apos; very soon &apos; will presented to the egyptians for be subject to referendum . 
&apos; the revolution has again &apos; 
ago weeks that the opposition is closing discussed with to the superiority of the islamists . 
ten thousand people is met in a unusual harmony in the later of friday in the square tahrir of cario and juraron do fail the acta before of that can into in force . 
&apos; the revolution has their and end defeating &apos; , says hamdin sabbahi , that as the third place in the lists to the elections presidential . 
the nobel of the peace and exdirector of body international of energy atomic , mohamed el-baradei , declared that the draft of the constitution should be &apos; in the dustbin of the waste of the history &apos; . 
to through of twitter was to the followers of mursi of issue lead a &apos; coup of state against the democracy &apos; . 
&apos; when convened the referendum go to their palacio and what derrocaremos &apos; , says the flee jasser understand . 
&apos; still not we tired , the blood of our brothers still not has been expiada &apos; , is from in the media egyptians to political flee chaled ali . 
and several judges announced that not wanted monitor the referendum , by what that not is considered valid . 
&apos; the koran is our constitution &apos; 
by their part , the community muslim well organised was a call for so a contramanifestaciOn ; by if are not in the square tahrir , but after a sentence to another hand of disputed , to the university of the cairo . 
many women covered with a entering and supporters of the salafistas were part in the same to out of : &apos; the people requires the implementation of the law god-given &apos; . 
demanded to mursi &apos; its the country &apos; , to same time that proclamaban : &apos; the koran is our constitution &apos; . 
a fight by the sovereignty of the symbolic square tahrir , where started all , would caused a situation similar to the of a war civil . 
is clear that the supporters of mursi not wanted avail to that something so and . 
the brothers muslims said that therefore the that is who to draft of the constitution as the supporters of same would expressed their views high and clear . 
now would come the time of stop that the people bore in the ballot what direction should continue the country . 
in this sense , seems that the draft of the islamists has meet the majority . 
&apos; the expression &apos; rights human &apos; or even though &apos; 
assad abu saeda is blokland with this process constitutional forced that in reality should have disburse to february and have including to all the forces social . 
this lawyer of 48 years specialises in rights human and president of the organisation egyptian of rights human ( eohr ) for to the brothers muslims when is who by in prison or had that do with to a trial during the dictatorship of mubarak . 
not because compartiera their ideology , but because for he the rights human are indivisible . 
by this reason was &apos;he , condemned and imprisoned . 
&apos; and now the expression `derechos human &apos; or even though in the new constitution &apos; , is regrets in a conversation with the newspaper &apos; welt am bild &apos; . 
the enlargement of the powers of mursi to the three powers of state was that this lawyer is cypriots . 
the measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of at democratic and will to egypt to a new dictatorship . 
&apos; in place of strengthen the society civil , what that has fact the president is abolirla &apos; , is regrets saeda . 
without however , the democracy not can work without the organisations of the society civil . 
saeda is feel abandoned , also by the community international , the which noticeable the fight ideological that is taking place to on of disputed with a mixed of curious and tension . 
this could their in their against . 
a manifestante in the square tahrir means : &apos; you concibiendo a monster that not podrEis control &apos; .

i i in the small city of fagernes , to a three hours of oslo . 
is believer . the landscape is witnessed and that smell , always present , fleet in the air . 
the rakfisk is trucha in delicious that is is fermentar in water during , on of what anti-semitism that you what preference , to a year . 
to measure that oscurece and will doing more cold , the norwegians who in at to a festival that is is here , in fagernes , into to this manjar of what more , by so say , cautivador . 
&apos; is eaten oil and then is baby a glass of aquavit of a bitter &apos; , says havard halvarsen , fire-fighter of the city that is also what that is known as the &apos; general of rakfisk &apos; , that is for of organise the festival . 
by all both see people eating this fish that is have in small buckets and baseball of a bitter important quantities of the drink . 
&apos; to some people them like more the aquavit that the rakfisk &apos; , says havard . 
the drink can kill the smell . 
pruebo some analogues . 
if saying avoid overlook close of the nose , not is bad ; not is very different to a unitary of bar that has way a few kilometres in bus . 
the rakfisk is a product that from of a time very different , in the that the poverty azotaba norway and in the that , before of that existed the cooling , the fish is bore during the autumn undeclared in water and salt in barrels hermEticos . 
more later , in plenary winter , when already is well fermented , is out and , obviously with the ways active because to alcohol , is eaten . 
ago so only a generation , thousands of norwegians is were forced to leave their country in search of work , and 16th mainly to states united . 
currently , the population is increasing quickly ; more of 13 % are immigrants , attracted by the abundance of jobs of work , high wages and a completely system of services social . 
a aware of inhabitants of sweden , the old contravention and to ago not too much more rich that norway , comes to this country for work . 
the rakfisk is as something important , a part essential , although quite anti-semitism , of last of norway . 
is is between the dishes more expensive that is can buy . 
but , of fact , all is expensive . a cane of beer or a crush you cost the admired of 10 € ( $ 14 ) every one . 
norway not often by in the order of day of the news international and to the majority of norwegians them like that so be . 
here the people still is little ready to pronounce the name of anders breivik , the racist of extreme right that acribillO to shot and killed to 77 people , between the that had men , women and children . 
in their place , is refer to perpetrator as &apos; the basin of 22 of july &apos; . 
to the norwegians them costs great believe that in their calm country one of the their outside capable of commit such cruelty and murder . 
after very of the wealth current of norway is is the growth , since principles of the 70 , of a of the industries of oil and of gas more large of world . 
&apos; but the oil not is the only reason by the that we will so well &apos; , says anna , our camarera , while will and adequately of rakfisk and that , with their long melena rubia and their surprising eyes blue , represents the image of welfare norwegian . 
&apos; we , as want you.&apos; , people sensible &apos; . 
their english , as the of the majority of people in this country , is white . 
&apos; not we like boast , not we like the fanfare &apos; . 
norway has managed their wealth oil with very caution ; all , exception a small percentage of money from of this industry , is invested in a fund special in benefit of the future generations . 
while all the world malgastaba money that not had during the years that preceded to the crisis financial in all the world , norway remained the basically well closed . 
&apos; while we austrians in winter and do senderismo in summer , we pleased &apos; , says anna . 
&apos; and feed rakfisk &apos; , adds with a casual carcajada . 
i in the snow doing eu for feed something ; already i had enough rakfisk . 
now a clones of strongest is without doubt something different and quite suculento that saborear . 
but by the night , again that anti-semitism fish . 
the hotel in the that i alojo is one of the many local in the that is is a dinner of rakfisk in the that the appearance vote the better fish , or perhaps the that more being to test the buried nasales . 
a television has logged in direct with a presentador that has pajarita and that is surrounded of dishes of rakfisk . 
seems the contest of song . 
&apos; what are military points for the better fish there down in the mountains , thor-juergen ? &apos; 
&apos; here is our puntuaciOn , havard . &apos; 
there laughter and applause . 
a man is is of the wheelchair , perhaps beat by the aquavit . 
or perhaps are the refuelling of all that fish .

&apos; is a man very honest , very committed and with a excellent vision of country . 
is a fantastic man of state and , by above of all , is a person that know listen . &apos; 
without however , to another hand of state that not is the impression that has very people on their former governor . 
in nezahualcoyotl , known also as city neza , the contrast with the streets adoquinadas of valley of bravo not could be greater . 
escondida under stretches of appears high is , in many ways , a suburb of the own city of mexico . 
and the problems of municipality are also hard and urban . 
to principles of this year is asked the intervention of the military for that called in the fight against the gangs of drugs that operating in the areas and the violence against the women is especially serious .

while their mother mark the history , a was of mariana noticeable since the walls , together to a cross in the that is reads a only word : justice . 
without however , that is exactly what that the family says that is you has denied . 
&apos; the authorities of state i have treaty as if outside a old chismosa , a alborotadora , a quejica . 
what that want is that one simply accept what that them say and that is street &apos; . 
&apos; but that not can be so when have there many irregularities and so negligence &apos; , says . 
the on presidential that the president peNa grandson will the saturday will accompanied of a huge responsibility .

my crisis of identity mexicano-estadounidense 
says that many is were forced to leave mexico because to the lack of opportunities 
the mexican tend to criticise to the that is were ; says that reminiscent to the mexican of those times difficult 
navarrette observing that the mexicano-estadounidenses is are trapped between two worlds . 
in a recent journey to city of mexico , hardly had down by the absurdly and come to the area of has of immigration and already was completely confused . 
a notices did the way towards two fired : a for &apos; mexican &apos; and other for &apos; foreign &apos; . 
i was there a seconds without be sure towards where should go . 
to have grown in california central , during all my life i have called &apos; mexican &apos; . 
is is of taquigrafIa ethnic , of same way in that my friends of boston is refer to yes ourselves as &apos; irish &apos; or my friends of new york is as to yes ourselves &apos; italian &apos; . 
more later i decided by &apos; mexicano-estadounidense &apos; . 
but this was mexico . 
and , in the homeland of my grandfather , the taquigrafIa or the paragraphs not were necessary . 
simply was us . 
i spanish . what enough well as for manejarme during a interview in this language . 
but not i the level of vocabulary of a nativo and not i deshacerme of my accent american . 
so that i my passport us and i was in the eu of foreign . 
i in at time of this week in the that the president elected of mexico , left peNa grandson , visited the home white for meet with the president obama . 
in the agenda of day , as always that is meet the leaders of these two countries , electoral : immigration , drugs and trade . 
peNa grandson was look about also of growth of the economy mexican , a of the reasons by the that in these at is so likely that a mexican is there in mexico as that is draft to go to the states united . 
want partner with states united and canada and create in america a bloc trade to lifestyle of the union european . 
also , peNa grandson promised continue fighting against the can of the drugs in mexico , although not was details . 
for mexico , the relationship with the states united is very and is full of against . 
probably the majority of americans never is remember of that in 1848 the states united invaded mexico and belonging to their leaders to yield the half of their territory to tip of gunpoint . 
but for the mexican , that think in centuries , not in minutes , the elements that is what reminiscent are by all parties . 
so that , in the time in the that a official of the states united says any thing that such the more minimum criticism to mexico , empiezas to hear complaints , therefore in the press as between the elite mexican , on how the americans are usurpando the sovereignty of their neighbours . 
and the children of moctezuma is out in ordinary of war . 
and still so , for mexico , the relationship that really is all a challenge is the that have with the more of 35 million of mexicano-estadounidenses that live in the states united . 
we of against ? 
there much . 
in mexico there winners and losers , people for the that the country provided opportunities and other for the that not is so . 
the only reason by the that there many people of hungarians mexican living in cities as the angels , the vegas , columbus , denver or st for is that , in some point of our tree genealOgico , there a person , can that the father or the mother or one of the grandparents , to the that is you closed the door of the opportunities in mexico and had that leave towards the north . 
and the majority of the sometimes that person purpose in a profile particular : fur brown-skinned , a level of studies under , from of a people poor , etc 
us we their top-down and them we loyal . 
to mexico not . 
and , to despite of that perhaps we living now the dream american , to have gone to good schools and have had good jobs , not we lose never of view that what that we living is that , the dream american , and not the mexican . 
is possible that to sometimes our identity not is clear , but our bay yes that what is . 
is for the states united . 
also , we aware of that to many of the mexican lot to the elite of the class leader not them gustamos . 
the sense is mutual . 
we are as a reminder of a defeat humiliating and we who by above of card as if about of a category than that not is what enough mexican . 
our spanish never will what enough good and our links with mexico never will what enough strong . 
to their way of see , our existence is synonymous of failure . 
if our families not would failed in mexico , not is would gone . 
and now not we be trapped after this curtain of cotton , living well in the states united but , still so , as souls solitarias . 
my woman , that born in guadalajara and wine legally to the states united when was a girl , i reminds that there this roce between the mexican and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know with more strength who are and to the seconds this them bother . 
although is citizens of the states united , she is as part of the two countries . 
while therefore , many mexicano-estadounidenses that know feel that not are part of none of the two . 
we love listen to group mexican the share of north , but also to bruce springsteen . 
you what better of every country , but not be deep-rooted to none of them . 
in mexico we are as americans . 
and in the states united is we as mexican . 
now , for more still more the things , by what that i i been during my journey , some leaders mexican and some intellectuals want again to connecting with the diaspora . 
want that the mexicano-estadounidenses work as &apos; ambassadors &apos; of mexico accommodation , been their interests in the states united . 
dirIamos to our colleagues americans what fantastic that is visit that country and presionarIamos to the leaders political for that reforzaran their links with mexico . 
yes , clear ... 
that not will to through . 
there too against . 
and , with the inequality of wages , the corruption endemic and the violence by drugs , many of us not we so insurance of that be a country fantastic . 
i fear that you family to be alone with this idea , friends . 
is fair . 
if some mexican still not are prepared for pardon to the states united by the way in the that were to mexico ago a century and half , then have that accept the fact of that some mexicano-estadounidenses still are begrudgers by how is discussed to their family ago great least time . 
hmmm . 
perhaps be more &apos; mexican &apos; of what that i . 
this battles , new east half 
the high the ceasefire between israel and hamas well could be a basis little likely for the peace 
will have some day a peace lasting between arab and jews in east half ? 
another bloodletting of blood that seems indicate that any hope is in vain . 
in half of the so and arise further on who began first , countless of buildings have been lower to rubble ; more of 140 palestinians , the majority of them civil , and six israelis have been killed and , by first time , rockets from of gaza have fallen close of aviv aviv , the fixed of israel , and the city holy of jerusalem . 
but , to despite of that the israelis and the palestinians seem be community-based in their former conflict , all as them are in east half is changing . 
the spring arab what has longer all fact armour them whether or not , palestinians and israelis have been trapped in the amidst regional . 
perhaps this do that their fight be still more bloody that before . 
without however , there reasons for think that their lethal situation of point died could desencallarse . 
a war that or is lose or is earns 
to first view , the optimism seems currently very difficult of justify . 
even if is maintained the high the ceasefire agreed the 21 of november , the clashes of this week have reinforced to the hawks of both sides . 
the leaders of hamas , the movement islamist that has centre gaza since 2007 , contend have forced to the israelis to from , to despite of that gaza has received a good kicking . 
and to despite of have killed to some of their leaders and trouble to pressure to the 1.7 million of inhabitants of gaza in one of the corners more crowded and paid of planet , israel not has been end with hamas . 
of fact , hamas is gaining ground in west , the other part of palestine currently ruled by their implacable rival of fatah , the facciOn palestine more moderate . 
also , the leaders of hamas could come to the conclusion of that the time has to their favour . 
given that the islamists have gone gaining influence by all the world arab , hamas has fact amistades richest and powerful . 
turkey , a renaciente power regional that before had been the ally muslim more near to israel , has espoused the cause of hamas . also what has fact qatar , one of the states more rich and dynamic of gulf . 
the exultantes member of hamas say that the average moon islamist is crusade israel , since the lebanon to north , where dominates the partido-milicia hizbulA , and by syria , where the rebels of a trend every time more islamist could bring to bashar by , to come to jordan , where the allies of hamas are threatening to king . 
on all in the with south of israel , the growth of the brothers muslims targeted by the president muhammad morsi in egypt , with difference the more populated and fundamental of the countries arab , has changed the balance of the region . 
hosni mubarak , the dEspota guarding that lasting in egypt during 30 years to their fall in 2011 , not had too time for hamas . 
in change , the brothers muslims are cousins brothers of hamas and their leaders on more of the opinion popular . 
in future actions diplomatic , is possible that hamas 1.7 as leading to that not is can from , or even israel and the states united . 
while therefore , the arrived hard of israel sorry the conclusion opposite . 
in what that is concerns the question military , have since to hamas in their website . 
the system antiballistic cUpula of iron of israel has shown their effectively and many of the rockets of hamas have been destroyed . 
the israelis dormirAn more so ... during some time . 
in as to the diplomacy , states united is shows more firm that never ; many countries european also culparon to hamas of have started the last wave of violence . 
to all , israel has been . especially under the government of benjamin netanyahu , a first minister that has ignored widely the process of peace . 
although the rockets fired since gaza have over with the life of a 30 israelis since 2004 , israel not has had many terrorists suicide , in part thank to the barrier that corroe west , the main part of a territory aspiring to become in state of palestine , and protects the settlements jews that are increasing to despite of that , according the legislation international , are illegal . 
the mr netanyahu , whose party idea is has uk to a group of a line still more hard led by avigdor lieberman in the period run-up to the elections the 22 of january , is in a good position . 
by what mimar to these retorcidos palestinians dAndoles a state own ? 
if really gobernaran in west , not dispararIan rockets such and as have fact their compatriots in gaza ? 
is better they after that wall and them a good coup if rose the head . 
perhaps is will the arrived hard , although the spring arab could tamper their are . 
although the islamists that take the power in egypt and in other websites not have too hold to israel , their priority will address the difficulties internal . 
the budget of defence of israel is greater that the of their four neighbours arab together . 
an a war with the superpower of the area hardly will to the new governments arab to improve their economies . 
that the believer mr morsi has worked with barack obama for get the high the ceasefire is a good well and could drive the beginning of something . 
also the israelis should think to long long-term . 
with the rest of world arab becomes more democratic , deprived to the palestinians of their right to the self-determination is create a erupt that a day explotarA in the territories occupied by israel , of the same way that this week blew a bus in aviv aviv . 
the repression already is destroying the democracy in the state jewish and the demography worse the situation to measure that increases the population arab . 
the cruentas missions against gaza every two or three years for reject to hamas black a toll diplomatic every time greater . 
both sides need a right of people which to conflict . 
the solution still being the that pregonan people sensible of both sides , the majority of world foreign and this newspaper : two states and the afford of territory by part of israel by reasons of security . 
the hope , small to short long-term , is that the high the ceasefire given a little more of momentum to the people which that are fighting by this cause . 
egypt , that must start to to curb to the entry of weapons in gaza , together with turkey and qatar , is is in a situation without unprecedented for convince to hamas of that accept the idea of a state jewish based in the borders of 1967 , with exchanges of earth and a jerusalem shared . 
the arab outsiders to subject also should pressure to hamas and fatah for that is join . 
that help more to the creation of a state palestinian that the harsh attempt of obtain a category of state virtual in the un . 
the mr obama also has a important role in what that as to get carry to israel to the table of negotiating . 
during their first mandate omitiO it their own plan for the peace . 
of new in the home white , seems as of reluctant to roma their attention . 
this attitude is a blot vision of future . 
a east half stable is of vital interest for the states united . 
this means a agreement of peace between israel and palestine .

sandra has , of zico import pty co , a small company family , stated that the demand of pitilleras and covered of silicone for gaps the unpleasant images of the packets is had bells almost since zero ago two months , when the british american tobacco , britain &apos; &apos;s imperial tobacco , philip morris and also tobacco lost a directly to the law in the court supreme of australia . 
the mrs has stated that zico had sold to 6 units to calls retail and that was waiting more stocks . 
&apos; for us is a good business &apos; . 
according the experts , the possible obstacle is the popularity of the networks social between the sector demographic to that is us the plan . 
after a series of laws australian that prohibit the advertising in the television and the sponsorship of sports and that force to the majority of sellers to not to the cigarette to the view , the marketing of tobacco has last to take in line . 
australia has ban the advertising in internet to companies and pages website local , but not can constrain in pages foreign . 
&apos; if comercializas tobacco and so only you is this small window for promote your products , the space in line is the place more convincing in the that be &apos; , said becky freeman , researcher of health public of the university of international . 
freeman observed a increase of appears on trademark from of &apos; citizens of to ordinary &apos; articles in pages website of networks social as youtube , twitter and facebook . 
is ask if is is so only of a citizen private to who really you crazy the pushing marlboro and is has taken the trouble of to a video or if any company of marketing is behind of all this . 
the british american tobacco of australia pressed that the industry is focuses more in what that means the regulation new that in the marketing . 
the industry has come even to pay for that ukraine , honduras and the republic dominican recusen the new rules ; these countries are saying to the organisation world of trade that is is becoming the trade unfairly , to despite of that none of these countries has a volume of trade significant with australia . 
is likely that the wto dictate a resolution to middle of 2013 . 
plibersek stated that the government had had discussions with other countries that are recital apply laws similar in on of packaged of tobacco . 
in the year 2001 canada is became in the first country that introduced the mandatory of include images in the packets . 
currently are can in more of 40 countries , between the that is are brazil , turkey and ukraine . 
in great britain , new zealand , south and india is is recital apply laws more tough . 
in australia many smokers is show harsh . 
&apos; the photographs not i affect . 
simply not them i case &apos; . 
&apos; coges the cigarro and guards the package &apos; , says betancourt the hage while buying a package with the image of a by in the their . 
&apos; sincerely , only there a reason by the that cease of smoking : by my daughter . &apos; 
james yu , managing of estanco king of the pack in the centre of international , points that the packets uniform do that you making more complicated get in the shelves . 
&apos; normally better a time in desenvalar a over ; now tardo four &apos; , says yu . 
&apos; the government should have ban completely the tobacco and then , already is , is , is over and stood the shop &apos; , says while comments the hands towards down . 
in a world constantly logged , not is so bad dull a little 
during the parties of day of action of thank of this year , of way unexpectedly i that through five hours in a airport because the air in the that volAbamos suffered a problem electronics and had that wait to that would another air . 
so that i great time for think in the platitude . 
not you i to lie . 
pasarse half day in a airport waiting to that comes a flight is quite boring , even if you media for be fun , as books , weeklies or iphones , without ignore of the shops critical . 
but every time there more academic and experts in development child that add the arm of platitude . 
according them , is well that , therefore us as our children , we aburramos of time in when . 
dull forced to brain to seek options interesting and can that encourage the creativity . 
given that , currently , the majority of us we connected to this or to that screen , not we the profits that provided the platitude . 
so that , should accept of good mind the platitude ? 
yes . 
and not . 
but , already we of this more forward . 
in first place , to as that very people , supposed that , now that we of more time for the leisure , the platitude would a phenomenon relatively recent . 
but , such and as says bit toohey , professor of history greek and roman of the university of calgary , in canada , and author of book &apos; boredom : to lively history &apos; ( &apos; the platitude , a history encouraged &apos; ) published in 2011 by yale university associated , not is so . 
&apos; of fact , the history of platitude is very can &apos; , says . 
in the walls of pompeya there graffitis in latin on the platitude that dating of century i 5th 
also we ourselves how define the platitude . 
&apos; the problem is that already is has defined and discussed of very various ways &apos; , points john am eastwood , professor of psicologIa of the university of york in ontario , canada . 
after at the research articles and raise the idea to a group of discussion set by 100 people , the professor eastwood and their colleagues defined the platitude as the experience of &apos; desired , but not power , participate in a activity that you full &apos; . 
says that the difference between the platitude and the apathy is that the person not ago something but want do . 
out that with the apathy not there the i of do something . 
the experience main of platitude , says , is &apos; the at of process of attention , associated to a under state of mind and to a that of that the time is slowly &apos; . 
the platitude can sounding thrown be to the depression . 
without however , the professor eastwood says that , although they be related , the people that are blank tend to see the problem as a question of environment or of world , while that the people that are depressed they that the problem what have them . 
to sometimes we that we boring , when what that we is in reality is that we problems for with . 
in their study &apos; the unengaged mind : defining boredom in terms of attention &apos; , published in the edition of september of the magazine perspectives as psychological bamst , the professor eastwood and their colleagues is were to a experiment previous in the that the participants escuchaban a cut of a person that saturation the article of a magazine . 
some groups heed in the room neighbouring a programme of television to all volume that not bore no relationship , other what heed with the volume under , of way that hardly was impatience , while that the third group not listened the audio in no time . 
the group that listened the programme with the volume under was more platitude that the other two groups ; them cost focus , but not were insurance of by what and what atribuyeron to platitude . 
&apos; when intentas concentrarte in a task difficult or interesting , the at of the attention can carry to platitude &apos; , pressed mark a4-0552 fenske , professor of neurociencia of the university of guelph , in ontario , and one of the authors of study . 
&apos; by another hand , when be doing something boring , as detect parts changing in a line of manufacture , a music that you distraiga you can help to not aburrirte &apos; . 
&apos; of fact , currently know that ! or do garabatos , actions that to often is days as sign of platitude , can in reality help to combat , already that do that that person is physically more warning &apos; . 
&apos; the research shown that those children to the that is them allows ! learn more and observation more information that those to the that is them forced to be advances &apos; , says the professor fenske . 
all know what that is dull in some time : the delay of a air , a speaker spin , a film especially dismally . 
but some people have more trend to dull that other . 
for help to medirlo , some researchers perfectly in the years 80 a &apos; level of trend to platitude &apos; . 
the level includes issues as &apos; many of the things that i that do are repetitive and monOtonas &apos; and &apos; there many things that i interested that not i time of do all &apos; . 
hosted vodanovich , professor of psicologIa of the university of west florida , says that , being these patent , the researchers have discovered that the boys have more trend to dull more to often that the girls , and particular need more stipulation external and more diverse . 
but , in general , the adolescents are a kind of group that is boring with quite easily . 
in 1991 , reed larson , professor of development human and community of the university of illinois , was to out a experiment in the that is were in contact with 400 adolescents and with their parents between seven and eight sometimes to day by a search . 
found that the 32 by % of the adolescents said that is aburrIa while was in the school or doing the duties , while that the 23 by % said that is aburrIa when not was in the school . 
by another hand , the 3 by % of the parents were that is aburrIan . 
the professor larson said that not was if the rates of platitude current , 21 years after , would with or lower . 
but said that what that yes was was that &apos; the adolescence is a period in the that the platitude than their correctness more highest &apos; , in great part because to that therefore to the children as to the adolescents not is them is a great control on what that want do . 
so that , back to my question of principle : is good dull ? 
to sometimes not what is , already that , taken to extreme , can do that we danger to risks physical absurd , as do betting or fall in the consumption of substances as method for combat , such and as shown the research . 
by another hand , many acropolis and writers about of the connection between the platitude and the creativity , according says the professor vodanovich , that has state at this question during more of two decades . 
&apos; the platitude is the way that has the brain of advice that we be doing other thing &apos; , says fringes marcus , professor of psicologIa of the university of new york . 
but the brain not always know what is what more appropriate . 
if be boring and colourful that energy for play the guitarra or cooking , that you satisfy . 
but if you the television , is possible that you who to short long-term , but not to long long-term . 
&apos; so that , if your son is boring and you feed a ipad , is possible that already not is aburra , but not will learned to full by yes same or to dosificarse &apos; , says the professor fenske . 
and &apos; that capacity of dosificarse is applies to other situations &apos; , out . 
your son not only learns to full by yes only , but that learns to continuing better in other areas . 
not i that really want impressed the platitude . 
but not should be too critical with he . 
our aim should be , more well , the of my close paragraphs of rumour constant of the activities and the technologies . 
the professor eastwood is of agreement . 
&apos; to our way of see , need aburrirnos more , but the platitude is a i too distressing and disturbing as for feel with something that deserves the worth &apos; , says . 
out that what that the people really search is a way of decommissioning and of enjoy of a time died . 
&apos; in a environment in the that we constantly sobreestimulados &apos; , says , &apos; is difficult find forms of focus our attention when the noise by &apos; . 
colorado : without book of instructions for the new law on the consumption of marijuana 
anthony orozco , student of 19 years in a institute community and came of south-east of colorado , is faces to a process criminal by something that soon will legal in all the state : the possession of a stones of marijuana and a painting that dispense for fumarla . 
orozco says that a day of september , he and some friends conducIan by lamar , in the plains registrars to the border of kansas , when the outside the police . 
the police found marijuana in the car and a time after orozco received a induced legal by possession of drugs and articles related ( crimes under that threat every one a fined of 100 dollars americans ) in the that is you pointless of the date of trial . 
&apos; we who as to criminal &apos; , says orozco . 
and what are ? 
in the weeks of uncertainty following to the vote that had place in colorado for the legalisation of the believes of small quantities of marijuana for use purposes , the answer in hundreds of causes under by believes of drugs on least of the law that of the location . 
hundreds of crimes under by possession of marijuana is are interference therefore here as in the state of washington , where is adopted a measure similar . 
the departments of police have longer of it charges against the elderly of 21 years by possession to small level , that is will legally a time the law has entered in force in the next weeks . 
but the tax of districts more conservatives of colorado is have committed to continue forward with the cases open by possession of marijuana and still are quote to people . 
to same time , several cities , since the suburbs of denver to the mountains western , are voting for prevent that is open shops of marijuana , no-fly recently , in their communities . 
&apos; all this is changing so quickly that not know what will what next &apos; , said daniel a4-0552 oates , head of police in aurora , fair to this of denver . 
those is at of the regulations in the state of washington also are our around to subject . 
and are for advice for establish a system of licensing of production , manufacture , distribution and sale ; all this before of that comes the date limit , the 1 of december of 2013 . 
say that , for well or for bad , colorado will by front of the majority of the states in as to the regulation of use of the marijuana , first with purposes terapeUticos and now for use purposes . 
&apos; colorado at of a market more regulated , so that will a good guide &apos; , says brian 661 smith , spokesman of the commission of control of alcohol of state of washington . 
but the mr smith accepts that any place or system only can do suggestions on what that could work . 
&apos; not there a real precedent that we as of model &apos; , says . 
the law of washington , so-called i-502 , enter in force the 6 of december , what that is also a year during the which is nadarA between two waters , already that the system of licensing in that state still not will , but the possession will legal . 
also , there some issues brings sensitive that must resolved during that period , as the way of keep a balance between the demand of state of offer a &apos; access appropriate &apos; to the marijuana authoritative and their ban of to business of cannabis in a radio than to 300 metres of schools , parks , areas of at children or centres children . 
&apos; in no place will more difficult ubicar a business of cannabis authorised that in the areas urban , especially in the area cause of seattle &apos; , says ben livingston , spokesman of centre for the cannabis legal , a group of research created recently . 
the 21 of november , oates , the head of police of aurora , sent a e-mail electronic to their players of police in the that them pointless of that the tax of the city cease of launch actions judicial by untruths very by possession of marijuana to people elderly of 21 years and of that the police cease of it charges against these crimes &apos; with effect immediately &apos; . 
the head of police oates said that them is away of do with the regulation of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana with purposes therapeutic and that begrudgers pursued to traffickers and sellers of drugs . 
in the county of weld , in the north of colorado , the tax of district , ken buck , represents a vision more strict . 
after the vote , assured that their office alleged pursued the cases of possession of marijuana , mainly for pressure to the consumers and that is have to receive treatment . 
currently , 119 people is face to charges by possession of 56 low or least of marijuana , although many of them have other charges . 
&apos; our office has the duty of launch actions judicial against those untruths that in the time in that is there were crime &apos; , said the mr buck in a declaration . 
the answer has been very even in places as the county rural of table , where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalisation of the marijuana . 
the police of continued junction , the greater city of county , already not quotation to adults by possession of small quantities . 
pete hautzinger , tax of district of county , supported this decision , but also decided not presented none of the cases outstanding by possession . 
&apos; not i that is losing the time to continue doing with the law to that this changes &apos; , stated . 
to despite of that the 55 by % of the voters supported the measure , never is was that carry the consumption of marijuana for use purposes to within of government and of system legal outside to be easy . 
the reactions contradictory that arise by all the state out of clear a marked ambivalence between the officials regard of great experiment create in this state . 
&apos; is is of a barrier cultural with the tax of district &apos; , says are mcallister , a lawyer of denver that represents to the accused by possession of marijuana and that is spokesman local of the organisation national for the reform of the law on the marijuana . 
&apos; have last therefore time moment to people to the courts that , in reality , still not can accept that be legal &apos; , stated . 
to be the first states that they the quantities small of marijuana of the same way that if outside alcohol , colorado and washington is prepare for become in the cases of test to level national in as to the legalisation of drugs . 
while lawyers and officials of state have with a new border of sales legal , also expect desperately receive indications of government federal , that still no the consideration of the sale and the cultivation of marijuana as crimes federal . 
the defenders of the legalisation of the marijuana have the hope of that the department of justice stand . 
to despite of that is have been some leading arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for purposes therapeutic , the government federal has allowed in their majority that there business of sale of marijuana with these purposes in colorado , washington and 16 states more . 
&apos; although is likely that the players drug not tiren doors collapsed for boxes a stock of drugs small , probably is will averse to allow the functioning of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for use purposes , one in the new law &apos; , said kevin by sabet , a exasesor of policy drug of the administration of obama . 
several cities of colorado not expect to that act the authorities federal . 
even before of day of the elections , some governments local adopted allow on any shop new of marijuana , to despite of that will around of a year before of that who of them can open . 
the week last , the city western of montrose adopted a ban of six months and is likely that the support the week that next . 
&apos; not want put in a situation in the that admittedly to someone and then we a serious problem to level federal &apos; , he approaching nicholson , member of city . 
&apos; our community voted in against of this amendment . 
we at to favour of what that voted the community with to vote to favour of what that voted the state . &apos; 
arise many questions to regard . 
petronella wyatt : &apos; i acosaron to down of oxford by be a hunted &apos; 
not is strikes to the university by their points of view only now 
not i no time in my life in the that not has state boggles in get a square in the university of oxford . 
therefore my father as my brother greater had state in the that i supposed was the better place of world for learn , a symposium greek of the was contemporary that approve the two pillars of the civilisation : the thinking free and the tolerance . 
without however , to the two weeks of should my square in the worcester impress to end of the years 80 for welcome the career of history , already had fact the bags , what that triggered the first scandal of my life . 
my father is crumbled and is footsteps to our . 
my friends were confusion . 
the newspaper the evening standard stated that i had abandoned because not toleraba that some colleagues of university maintained relations sexual in the room of to hand . 
the he by n. wilson announced jest that i had gone because i compelled to drinking in tazas desconchadas . 
the truth was least funny . 
huI of there . 
yes , huI , because had state put to a systematic harassment and intimidation . 
not because to my extravagante name , or to fact of that would of a school private . 
i acosaron by a only reason , that in the cradle of the so-called illustration was something bigotry and barbaric : my father , the inspired woodrow wyatt , was a &apos; advisory of margaret thatcher and i himself to party conservative . 
perhaps is ask to what next that now . 
well , several reports show that a new generation of students of centre right is suffering a persecution similar . 
the hatred institutionalised and growing towards the students of party conservative is such in oxford that , the week last , a group of them called the same level of equality of rights that have the homosexual , the disabled and the minorities ethnic . 
member conservatives of the jcr ( grouping of students of degree ) of corpus christi impress claim that are &apos; to often seriously paragraphs , personally attacked and treaties as people not objected &apos; by their ideas policies . 
want create a since in the committee of equality of opportunities of their school university for ensure of power express their views freely . 
their situation not is was acts by a recent documentary of the bbc2 called &apos; individuals : ernst , bright and as the right &apos; ( the paradise : young , we and of right ) on the policy of the students and that presented to the tories as excEntricos and bnp . 
mostraba to student of master joe cooke , expresidente of the partnership of party conservative of the university of oxford ( ouca ) , in a &apos;t , baseball a suit carefully and a bullfighting with the empuNadura of silver . 
in other universities , the students conservatives say that is them is as &apos; them of turkish &apos; by the introduction of rates of stops more do . 
luke black , of 20 years and vice-president of the partnership of party conservative of the university of damage , declared in a newspaper alleged that &apos; there a growing trend of left in the universities . 
the people helping that we as the bullingdon club without or so even conocernos &apos; . 
samuel albert , of 21 years and student of history in corpus christi that presented the motion for a greater protection , says that this environment is &apos; you &apos; , while that stephanie cherill , of 19 years and president elected of the ouca , says that the attitude of the member of the jcr towards the people that are of centre right has worsened . 
&apos; this is a threat for the environment of debate intellectual , so as for the welfare of the member &apos; , says . 
during my first weeks in oxford was more single that the a . 
there in the university in september of 1986 , was a young of 18 years thrown timid . 
the hatred towards the party conservative was in their point more high . 
the year previous , the university had voted can to margaret thatcher , former alumna , a title &apos; honorary cause &apos; after the cuts in the funding of the education higher . 
the environment would fact horrifying of appalling to any stalinist . 
already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university , when the new students is know and know to the professors , received a shows of the bitterness that i than . 
found that the professors not only doing the view blind to the mofa that is was of the university conservatives , but that involved in she of good earns . 
the policy of the strike of the miners , the privatisation and the opposition of government to the sanctions against the apartheid in south came to the rooms of wood of seminar . 
to first that i is be into to english texts french of century 18th and i not was ready for what that wine to continuation . 
&apos; seNorita wyatt &apos; , said the professor harry pitt ( already died ) , &apos; by favour , translates the first paragraph &apos; . 
not realised or a . 
pitt , a man bajito with a face that seemed mass of bizcocho , was well how who bad bilis . 
&apos; is that the thatcheristas is refuse to learn french or is that , simply , are questioners ? &apos; , asked . 
the other university is laughed . 
i brought the eyes of the tears that was of contain . 
&apos; you suggest that will to classes of french in their time free , always and when not is too occupied gets people &apos; , gruNO pitt . 
returned to my room as a soul in worth . 
that night i sat single to the time of the dinner in the university ; then felt a there away in the on . 
was a student of english of second year called james that is presented as member of the ouca . 
&apos; know who you &apos; , i said latter . 
&apos; i fear that so is as will the thing . 
is mouths with who that be suspect of be hunted . 
for me is very complicated , but know that your father is near to margaret thatcher , so that for you will still worst . 
many tories would newcomers aparentar be labour &apos; . 
more forward , in a in local , i attack hide . 
stressed in that not was of agreement with all what that said the mrs thatcher . 
that trick was pointless . 
a student of first year of philosophy , policies and economy that , paradoxically , had examined in eton , said : &apos; you daughter of a pig fascist . 
be arrangement &apos; . 
other students adopted that cancioncilla . 
i became in the dosage pervertida . 
&apos; how have relations sexual the tories ? &apos; , asked one . 
&apos; is give a kicking the one to another , not ? &apos; 
i felt of the same way that should have sense the homosexual before of the law liberal of the years 60 . 
could some day carry a life normal in oxford ? 
i would forced to be with people that advise as i only after of anochecer ? 
would that plenty labour and embraced my trends natural ? 
the three years that i were is were as a going of assumption and isolation . 
the only professor openly hunted was norman rolling , professor of history contemporary aimed to my school university . 
you odiaban by be not only of party conservative , but also advisory of thatcher in policy foreign and a of the people that you alexandra their speeches . 
hardly was by there . 
detestaba the place by that what he parochial and minor and by their emissions to the vision marxista-determinista of the history . 
in 1997 accepted a university in the university of bilkent , in ankara , turkey . 
&apos; here not you to be happy &apos; , i said . 
started to him daily of oxford to home of my parents in london , finding refuge in my family and friends of mentality cause more open . 
you i to my father that hated oxford and by what . 
not i believed . 
when he long there in the years 40 , is deleting all the points of view political . 
&apos; but if is the better place of world &apos; , said with sadness . 
&apos; them never would that , not there between my dear needlestick of dream . 
to my friends communist always had a attitude white &apos; . 
their doloridos eyes detected to nublarse . 
&apos; dale other opportunity . 
i sure of that what have fact only for bromear . 
is i depths the heart if what dejaras . &apos; 
committed of many travel to london , my resistance emotional is was deteriorating . 
a friend mine , that also himself to party conservative , had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced to their cultures . 
the week next , during a seminar in the that another professor of history had hinted , talking completely in seriously , that i was a &apos; enemy of people &apos; , decided do what same . 
red of shame by within , admitI that my parents i had &apos; laundering the brain &apos; and them dg1 &apos; old broke &apos; . 
the truce for little time . 
was my father who that the last coffin in the coffin of my career university in oxford . 
by at then my father in two columnas week in the press of murdoch . 
my door was closed with key . 
i was within acurrucada of fear and , automatic five minutes , my equates desistieron . 
when is were i the alarms and took the first train to london . 
never returned . 
perhaps i llamEis weak llorona . 
but no person of 18 years should be put to such level of intimidation and hostility in a institution amusing . 
what that is still more tragic is that was oxford , that not only has set to 14 first ministers of party conservative but that , to day of today , is behind after a ensure nothing delight of equality and freedom of thinking . 
&apos; Alvarez prefer the elegance to the thus &apos; 
with reason of the shows &apos; Alvarez : master of the remnant &apos; , that is has decade this week in london , abc about with naty abascal , fiona thyssen-bornemisza and other budgeting clientas of designer italian

singapore search babies for save the economy 
the singapurenses blaming to the career , the stress and the costs of the properties and the education by not have children . 
&apos; the population of singapore needs grow &apos; . 
am a husband gained , you my wife patriOtica , do with our duty civic and we life ! 
can appear be that these home are part of a announcement of tablets of menta , but to despite of that - or perhaps because to that - the webstreaming is came viral in youtube in singapore to principles of this year . 
the sentences are part of a aspects that used no local as &apos; we to to a bao ( bollo ) in the oven &apos; for laughing of the rate of birth of singapore . 
the company of advertising that was the webstreaming , bbh , hosts the hope of that with the announcement forgetting draw the attention on the problem of a way funny . 
their director creative , douglas hamilton , says that wanted use the power of the music for that the people ! with &apos; their duty national &apos; . 
this is something purely of internet , so that had that do fun and funny . 
is the greater problem in this country . 
we the worst of world in reproducirnos to us ourselves , so that feel that this was a issue that we that address . 
knew that the government had tried many things , as launch perfumes with feromonas or organise veladas of from anxieties ( speed-dating ) . 
many of these ideas can have been creative , but not necessarily worked . 
so that we , by what not we what more creative possible for right this problem , that is componer a aspects ? 
1.2 children 
the that not is what decision-making so to the there is the government of singapore . 
spent us $ 300 to year in policies for encourage to the citizens to have more children . 
a package of government for marriages and parents make to 15 dollars by child , or the licensing by leave and spread profits tax . 
but all this has had little effect . 
singapore is a city state rich and of high technology in the south-east of asia , also known by the conservatism of their leaders and their needed controls social . 
the rate of birth of singapore , of agreement with their division national of population , is at currently in 1.2 children by woman . 
the last time that was by above of 2 -conocida as rate of reposiciOn- was in 1976 . 
so that by what the singapurenses not have more children ? 
so wei ming , director of policies of marriage and family of the division national of population , says that is because to a &apos; better education &apos; and &apos; a range more wider of opportunities of career &apos; . 
&apos; that you has allowed to the people have of a range more wider of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities , more beyond of incorrect and be a family &apos; , explains . 
these changes in the rules social have contributed to increase of the solterIa , and to delay the marriage and the births , what that is as result a drop of the rate of birth in singapore . 
while therefore , a policy of immigration eu tip to increase drastically the immigration for on with to the drop of the population has created umbrage between the population local . 
in singapore there websites website where rife the xenophobia hardly disguised against many new immigrants , in particular the chinese , to the that critics by keep the wages netherlands and not integrated . 
the increase of the immigration also is seen as a of the reasons by the that the year last the party of government of singapore chilling their worst result electoral since the independence . 
since the elections has there a attempt of correct the problem , with the quotas and taxes more higher for the workers foreign . 
consequences some 
while that the fall in the rate of birth has effects known in the growth economic of a nation , the income tax , the costs health and the policies of immigration , the example of singapore also is taking some consequences some . 
the government is that not is built many houses small . 
by example , has started to affect to sector estate . 
the authority of development urban has last to control the number of over small , known as &apos; box of shoes &apos; , that is they build in certain areas of the city . 
these over have land of 46 metres square and have had much success of sales . 
without however , there concern of that they promote a lifestyle of life of solterIa and desanimen to the developers that want build houses large , family . 
but lim 1952 chee , director general of the company buildings the developers , says that their &apos; boxes of shoes &apos; is sold much more rapid that the units more large . 
are more popular , in the sense of that the units is exhausted days , even weeks , more rapid that the units of greater size . 
this ago that be much better for our flow of box . 
without however , accepts that the new rules give guidelines more clear for the developers , to the that before is them were are if wanted offer too units small in a project . 
too estresados 
singapore is a city state . 
if well these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the rate of birth national , to about with the singapurenses that working in the district financial of centre appear that not will to have much effect . 
&apos; the people is very marge , the houses are sides and also what is the education , by what that many people what are postponing &apos; , says a young executive . 
other people can have children . 
&apos; but for me is important have with my own money and time &apos; , says another young of a 20 years . 
men and women mention their career , the stress and the costs of the properties and of the education as the reasons that them from have children . 
so that , by much that the government involved of force to their citizens to have children , when is is of do babies , the singapurenses are those have the last word .

observing that the issue is complex , &apos; because them we asking that have a criterion defined on what be or not salvage , publish or say to a age that the mature not is for that &apos; . 
&apos; also that are was when what that more them care is be popular , have thousands of friends without think in the consequences &apos; , adds .

the president brutally is was , also , to favour of the up of the organisation of states american ( aims ) under the premise of down the influence of the states anglo-saxon and have in account to the that have signed the pact of st josE on the rights human . 
the that give university never is themselves to nothing and , in change , us the suramericanos what arrangement all . 
&apos; is incomprehensible that the commission urged of rights human is in washington under the funding of states united &apos; , stated in referring to asylum political given by ecuador to founder of wikileaks , julian assange . 
correa assured that not is arrepentido of that decision because with this not has betrayed their principles , but that has respected their &apos; profound values democratic and of rights human &apos; . 
manner that , in their time , &apos; had olaf cruel of that assange outside extradited to a third country and not is honoured their process &apos; . 
listening , also , to the justice swedish by demand that is submitted in their territory to interrogation by a alleged crime sexual when &apos; the own legislation swedish allows type by relevant , that is could do since the embassy of ecuador in london &apos; . 
correa stated that there the risk of that is deteriorate the health physical and mental of assange . 
&apos; not i about with he since that is in our embassy , but the her i informed that had a small problem allegedly , nothing serious &apos; , said the attorney brutally . 
what that yes there is the danger of that is deteriorate their health physical and mental by be he in a space small without power do exercises to air free . 
&apos; that complicates the health of any person &apos; , manner .

us not negotiate with rights human , that word not the we in this case , but has there permanent discussions . 
&apos; the solution of this problem is in hands of great britain , sweden and of the authorities legal european because the lawyer of assange , baltazar baltasar , is doing a series of procedures in different bodies european &apos; , mentioned . 
and opinion that &apos; if great britain is morning the convince this is has &apos; . 
and if sweden , as perfectly what allows their legislation and as has fact in other cases , interroga to mr assange in the embassy of ecuador in london or what interroga way skype morning same is has this problem . 
correa availed for assert as a ombudsman of the freedom of press and matizO that what that not does is &apos; the mediocrity , the bad faith and the lie , that lead the freedom of expression &apos; . 
&apos; the elderly enemies of the freedom of press not we the political villains and grievously but the bad journalists in role of profit , the blackmail and the extortion &apos; , said . 
in that aspect is welcomed that already not are these journalists &apos; or the bankers or the countries hegemonic and class the that dominated to ecuador &apos; , and forward that of be his &apos; profundizarA in the revolution for continue the way and the direction right &apos; . 
correa also supported the decision of keep the veto to paraguay in the aspect to least to their next elections , to argue that the body &apos; must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the golpismo enormously of legality &apos; because in reality &apos; destroyed the legitimacy of the democracy paraguaya &apos; . 
the president brutally was , also , &apos; perfectly relevant &apos; the i of their counterpart apologetic , juan manuel ends , of negotiate now with nicaragua the limits seaports between both countries after the failure of the court international of justice of the has , that benefited to the sovereignty maritime nicaragUense . 
by the time not is by that failure . 
is a problem between a country american and one centroamericano . 
the conflicts are inevitable , but must be overcome by the will of i together . 
there that import of way wider for resolved and continue forward . 
also approve in a good conclusion of apparent by limits seaports that have in the same court peru and chile and opinion that &apos; is right for america latin seek bodies international if the two countries is themselves to accept failure by hard that be &apos; . 
in reference to the possibility that is present as candidate in the next elections presidential in ecuador for seek a third mandate running pointed that is that possibility &apos; with much optimism and joy , although to sometimes is quite hard &apos; . 
correa assured that if lose the at of february of 2013 is will of the life public . 
in what personal never i has interested the power , but in situations so upon as the of ecuador that poverty socio-economic only is can correct since the power political . 
&apos; my movement pOlitico believed that was i who defaults that likely victory , therefore we that accept that reponsabilidad &apos; , said . 
of win would my last period in the presidency and of there are of the life public . 
if lose as .

deaths by aids today are cause of detection mention 
fabrizio had 21 years of age when you anticipated the result of the test : aids positive . 
&apos; was as if i out a bomb &apos; , concerns to recap the time of announcement , that the doctor he do &apos; more suavecito &apos; , without success clear . 
the child what kept to their family . 
decided done office only of their disease and started to needs on she ; with such as that already festejO their birthday 43 . 
is , without doubt , one of the patients more old of the unit of hiv of hospital civil of guadalajara ( hcg ) , to the that was in 1994 after of several battles . 
fabrizio live with the virus of the line human ( hiv ) since ago 22 years , something difficult of imagine to principles of the 90 , when had many doubt , few options of treatment and more stigma . 
then , to the director of a clinic of imss blackout despedirse of he &apos; because traIa a cut &apos; . 
then , have aids was synonymous of death . 
now is possible survive to this syndrome and do with quality of life . 
without however , , of their disease , still many people they when the virus already has caused havoc , &apos; reached &apos; their system immune and are victims of infections opportunistic . 
to 31 years of the emergence of aids in the world , to least of the first cases reported , &apos; the great achievement means in this time that the sobrevida of a patient that found treatment in way be and the sobrevida of the population general , is exactly as &apos; , pressed the head of the unit of hiv of hcg , jaime andrade villanueva , after ensued that this information was supported in april of this year in a publication scientific prestigiada . 
infectOlogo and expert in hiv / aids , andrade villanueva a that since the year 2008 , the scientists had concluded that the aids not was a ruling fatal , but the years of survival and the quality of life on of degree of afectaciOn to system immune that have the patients to an the diagnosis , with better expectation for those not are users of drugs : of to 30 years with a conteo of 200 cd4 and of 50 years , when actions 500 cd4 . 
in words simple , what previous means that who , the diagnosis of hiv positive to the 25 years of age , under these terms &apos; while is keep in control will live without problems to the 75 years &apos; , he the ashraf . 
for dimensionar this progress , is remember that the hope of life of the mexican today is of 76 years in average . 
if well the mortality has down significantly in the last years , in the case of mexico , the number of people that die of aids bowed of 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 ( reporte annual of unaids ) , also is true that since the emergence of aids , 60 by % of the patients in the basis of data national have died . 
only in jalisco 255 people died in 2011 , and will 187 deaths to may of this year ; not however is will that there access universal to the drugs anti-retroviral since 2005 . 
- by what still they deaths ? 
- to me i seems that the problem not is of access to treatment . 
so what visualizo , so we has happened in our hospital . 
to least in the last 12 years not we had desabasto of medicine the problem is that the patients they very advanced because not their state of infection , or be , in stages late of the disease . 
was a fact no : &apos; nine of every ten patients they when already have any infection declare what that is has that do for have a greater impact on the mortality global , is do verdicts more tempranos and , by what therefore , is have that offer evidence of detection of way mass , to all the people that what cost-intensive &apos; . 
in their proposal line specialists and officials of council state of prevention of aids in jalisco ( coesida ) , also the own patients , as fabrizio , who turned to done the test to a laboratory particular , only drove because what had fact a friend and , despite to their short age , already was in stage of aids and even padeciO sarcoma of kaposi , a by resembles that is a of the complications common . 
all time when know that you aids . 
some think that is will to die and not want know nothing . 
&apos; if already i i to die , better i reviento three sometimes to the week &apos; , say not in my case . 
the change was for improve , i food well , i exercise , i the medicines . 
to the date , their parents only know that padeciO cancer . 
live a life normal , as who . 
&apos; work , i many activities , i , i a life sexual active , but complicity , i cuido to me and to the other person &apos; , enumerO fabrizio , who accepted share their privacy with millennium jalisco for motivate with their relied to those today , in the framework of day world of aids , have fear . 
that is do the test , if had risk , that between more soon know if are hiv positive , is better and if already have the diagnosis , that learn that can live as any person , being responsible . 
this , their message , sums the motto of battle to aids this 2012 . 
condoms after the counter 
large are the missed that there between the programmes of health and the citizen common , affirmed leOn days , journalist tapatIo who has taken the cause in about to hiv . 
and the more large is in prevention . 
in the places dedicated to this task &apos; indeed is has increased the we of condoms , before we by of one or two , now we give packages of to hundred , and that is very well but is that there those today , still , not have access to a imprisoned &apos; , said . 
between the more vulnerable to new infections are the adolescents . 
&apos; for what the you ? &apos; is question common , with developed and trials of value of workers social , orientadores schoolchildren , employees of chemists and personal of health , to the that not is want forward the adolescents , assured the communicator . 
proposed re-orientate this ineffective we ; that the condoms not are only after the departure and these hundred is who in despachadores of bathing public of the websites that frequent the young . 
not is motivate the chlamydia . 
or is is of cent the chelas and the motel , as did the governor emilio gonzAlez , to ask if would we of condoms in their administration . 
&apos; so not is the acceptance , what better is closer the condoms to those already bars a activity sexual &apos; , pointed . 
encryption in jalisco 
there 13,435 cases cumulative ( 12,158 of aids and 1,317 of hiv ) . 
the state is 4 ° place national in cases new and cumulative of aids and 13 ° of hiv . 
92 % of the chlamydia is to the way sexual , 6 % to the way protect and 2 % to the way perinatal .

&apos; the basketball has been my life &apos; . 
on not exaggerated to do that experienced . 
the walls of their home , almost all decoradas with photos and memorabilias that apparent their wider very , so what point . 
bayamOn in the heart 
of all , the that has with greater ambivalent are the that rememoran their step by the vaqueros since middle of the 1990s of the 50 as player to 1982 , when perform 15 years fungiendo as coapoderado or before of the abolishing . 
&apos; these were my best years , the that more i disfrutE because i the opportunity of be part of eight championships of the vaqueros since 1967 , already it as before , coapoderado or leader . 
were many years of satisfacciones , including the five championships corridos since 1971 to 1975 . 
and then i actually with one in the 1981 , the year of debut of jerome mincy in the bsn . 
of there in forward is was office &apos; cuco &apos; ortiz , that was a great administrator &apos; , pressed on . 
i that gene bartow , that had at here and was in the university of alabama ( birmingham ) , i said : &apos; you i a player well strong , of 6 &apos; 7 &apos; of martyr . 
what you ? &apos; 
and that was the principle of mincy , one of the best players that has had port puerto . 
bartow then recommended to francotirador raymond gausse , that was nativizado and was one of our best competitions . 
i that said that if mincy you had given a championship to bayamon , gausse help to bring another more . 
the championship of the vaqueros with gausse is what gozO , but already to the distance , therefore for 1988 already was of mandamAs federativo . 
for that time would enjoy of their ejecutorias and the of mincy in the team national . 
i when you domestic by first time to states united during the preolImpico in mexico of 1989 . 
then wine the world of 1990 , where we fourth place and due have been bronze of not be by at umpire canadian that we was repeat the going end by second time , said on . 
that group of world of 1990 is the better team national that paca seen ? 
is between the best , as that the that you won to dream team in the deserve of 2004 . 
but my bookmakers was the of the panamericanos in cuba in 1991 , when domestic gold and you we a pela to team of states united , that was quite similar to that we won the bronze in the world . 
at team not only repetIa to mincy , gausse , ramon rivas , advice lOpez and &apos; piculIn &apos; ( ortiz ) , but that also had to ( javier ) &apos; toNito &apos; christopher and james argues young , to the brothers a ( which and bosnian ) and to mario &apos; figure &apos; evo , that not had been be in the 90 because to a injury in the bowed . 
a team that perhaps not was the better in terms of personal , but we was a medal of gold and a great joy was the of preolImpico of 1995 in neuquEn , argentina . 
with players of because as &apos; canito &apos; nieves , paul alicea and a youth rolando hourruitiner in replace of the players power-sharing by the are of panamericano of sea of silver , domestic gold against all the prospects . 
what has been the better player of port puerto ? 
without doubt any , that has been piculIn ortiz . 
their numbers to level of torneos international are impressive . 
nobody in port puerto has dominated to that level as what was piculIn . 
and that without have their very in the different have that playing . 
who has been the better leader boricua ? 
that is very difficult . 
we had a camada very good that includes to july grasp , cut melEndez , charles evo , raymond dalmau , armandito torres . 
of the young , i like much the work of shall arill .
