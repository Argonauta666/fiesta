a strategy extent for hinder the re-election of obama 
the leaders republicans justify their policy by the need of fight against the fraud electoral . 
now well , the centre brennan as this last a myth and says that the fraud electoral is least often in the states united that the number of people that die to cause of the fall of a glimmer . 
of fact , the lawyers republicans not have found more that 300 cases of fraud electoral in the states united in ten years . 
a thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation . 
in that sense , these measures minarAn in part the system democratic american . 
to contrary of what that happens in canada , the states american are responsible of the organisation of the elections federal in the states united . 
and in that same line a majority of the governments american instance , to from of 2009 , new laws that cancelled the process of register or of vote . 
this phenomenon is has widespread after the elections of november of 2010 , that were the increase of 675 new representatives republicans in 26 states . 
in result , during the year 2011 is introduced u-turn projects of law that assembly the exercise of right of vote in 41 states . 
the new laws election demand that the constituents be a document of identity with a was , also of a test of citizenship american . 
by other part , these laws reduced the periods of vote early-voting , invalidan the right to enrol as forrester in the day of polling and couple their right to vote to the citizens with background criminal . 
before of the elections of 2006 , no state american requirements that the constituents presentaran a document of identity with was . 
the state of indiana was the first in demand . 
the court supreme of the states united this in 2008 the being of the law of indiana . 
by this , the authorities republicanas is quick to extend that practice to other states . 
in the last years these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 states for force to the constituents to it a document of identity with was . 
is important have in account that , to contrary of what that is in quebec , the citizens american not have of a document of identity universal , as the card of the security social . 
of fact , a 11 % of the citizens american , is say , 21 million of people in age of vote , not have with no document of identity with was we by a agency government of their state . 
by another hand , five million of new constituents in 2012 not of a document of identity with these characteristics . 
but , to often , the obtaining of document of identity delays costs more of hundred dollars . 
with what which , the new restrictions affect of way disproportionate to the young , the minorities and the people with income netherlands . 
in effect , a 25 % of afroamericanos , a 15 % of people that who least of 35 dollars to year , a 18 % of the citizens of more of 65 years and a 20 % of the constituents of between 18 and 29 years not have with a document of identity with was . 
and still there more . 
in many states the students , the constituents that more vote to the candidates democrats , not can use the document of identity with was we by their institution . 
by other part , these ourselves states authorise to the member of the clubs of fishing or of hunting that usually vote to the parties republicans to use the documents issued by these clubs . 
before of 2004 no state requirements the test of citizenship for vote . 
arizona was the first state in it this demand . 
since 2011 , a dozen of states has adopted laws that demand that the constituents prove that are citizens american . 
these measures for , clearly , limit the vote hispano . 
seems be that two of every three constituents hispanos support to party democrat . 
by another hand , the legislators republicans supported in 2011 certain laws that abolIan the register of constituents the same day of polling in eight states . 
also , constrained the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the constituents that want enrol . 
these restrictions have consequences . 
by example , in the elections general of 2004 , the campaigns of register of the constituents contributed to registration of around of 10 million of citizens . 
the measures taken since 2009 reformation that the rate of register of new constituents out in 2010 in compared with the year 2006 . 
also , the legislators republicans adopted laws in other five states that importantly the reduction of period of vote by advance . 
by example , in the elections of 2008 in florida , a 33 % of the constituents that voted by advance were afroamericanos , while that these last not represented more that a 13 % of the constituents of state . 
in the case of the hispanos was exactly what same . 
these not represent more that a 11 % of the constituents , what that is to a 24 % of the citizens that vote by advance . 
without however , the white , that represent a 76 % of electorate , not represent more that the 46 % of the citizens that vote by advance . 
by course , the legislators democrats and their supporters is have conflicting desire to the adoption of laws that originating the registration of constituents . 
in this sense , the governors democrats have blocked several projects of law . 
the ministry tax of the states united intervened for decision the laws more controversial . 
is could , in part , limit the damage . 
by example , so only 16 of 34 states adopted the law that requirements the presentation of a document of identity with was . 
without however , is undeniable that the new rules taken complicarAn the exercise of right to vote in 2012 . 
the critical democrats have the nature firmly of the laws that is have voted , already that is clear that with them is to influence in the results of 2012 in the states key . 
a report of centre brennan of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent house of the 250-270 votes necessary in the school electoral for achieve the presidency . 
is too soon for say with certainty if these amendments legislative to level of system electoral will a impact significant in the results of the elections presidential of 2012 . 
a thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation . 
in this sense , the measures minarAn in part the system democratic american . 
detection of cancer of prostate : done the test or not apprising ? 
in effect , the test of psa is , in times , results definite , with counterfeit results negative or even counterfeit results positive , after the that is decided to speeches medical so . 
is a reason more that enough for do any to the men , already reticentes of by yes , on if should done or not the tests of detection . 
done the test or not ? 
we asked council to two specialists . 
in the studies by in the states united is was a great rate of chlamydia between the groups of shows , by what that is difficult read these data and do recommendations firm . 
by their part , the study european was certain difference of mortality between the patients that is had done the detection and the that not . 
the study , with a monitoring to the 12 years , proved also that there between the 30 and the 40 % of possibilities of chronically areas if not is has done the test of detection . 
recommend , by therefore , the test to from of the 50 years , or to from of the 40 years if your father has suffered cancer of prostate . 
the men of origin afroamericano have a rate of risk more high . 
the key is take a good decision a time outbreaks the cancer . 
there cancer aggressive and other cancer that are indolentes . 
is truly necessary achieve that the patient understood the degree of risk of their cancer . is you must offer all the options possible and not necessarily treat the cancer of prostate that not citizen-friendly against the life to long long-term , in whose case is must has more well by a surveillance active of the disease . 
today in day many men to the that is them has outbreaks a cancer not are treaties , since that said cancer not is aggressive or one a risk for their life . 
in their place , them we a surveillance active of the disease and , if this ahead , them we a treatment . 
determinamos every time with more often criteria precise for decide who should or not be treaty . 
recommend that is do the test in any case . 
but is important that about with their doctor for determine if must done the test or not . 
movember has created , in cooperation with the society international of urologIa , a tool that allows assess the pros and the pros of test of psa . 
is can onto this document ( by the time only in english , but is grants spending within of little ) in the next direction : http : / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens-health / prostate-cancer-screening 
prevent the disease 
unfortunately , not there a recipe miracle for prevent the cancer . 
to despite of the progress of the research , the adoption of habits of life made are being the better way of reduce the risks of have the disease . 
believe that if all the world comiera well and is certainly what enough , is could prevent a 30 % of the cancer . 
&apos; if nobody everywhere , that rate is 2.7 , to least , to 50 % &apos; , underlines andrE beaulieu , spokesman of the society canadian against the cancer . 
in change , evaluamos that around of 10 % of the cancer are inherited . 
many other are being completely explainable . 
for the society canadian against the cancer , the fight against the smoking still being a priority to despite of the drop of number of smokers . 
the tobacco is with with the 85 % of the cases of cancer of lung . 
is , also , a factor of risk for other types of cancer . 
particularly us the health of the people . 
&apos; today by today , still there 1.5 million of smokers in quebec &apos; , declared the spokesman andrE beaulieu . 
a fact hopeful : 10 years after of stop of smoking , the risk of die of cancer is reduces to the half . 
the weight 
the gordura and the obesity help also the emergence of the disease , according the scc . 
poorly the risks of cancer of breast , of bowel and of totally , of bathing-water , of pAncreas and of womb . 
&apos; the research shown that the practice regulate of activity physical during all the life protects against the cancer of breast &apos; , in . 
the food 
the body should , also , limit the consumption of it red . 
in large quantities , do career the risks of have a cancer colorectal . 
the products of charcuterIa also must avoided . 
the conservation of the meat for their ahumado , dried or delicious can cause the training of substances carcinogenic . 
&apos; can damage the cells of body and carry to development of cancer &apos; , we for . 
the vitamins 
in the last years , several scientists have examined the links between the complex correctly and the cancer . 
without however , by the time their research not are bombing . 
segU the scc , the studies about of the e and are contradictory . 
while that in one of them is discovered a drop of the risks of cancer of prostate , in another what that is observed was , more well , a increase . 
the effect of the e d in the cancer not is has been determine with clarity . 
by other part , gijs beaulieu should in the importance of about on the concerns and the background family of every one with their doctor . 
&apos; do the test of detection not from cancer . &apos; 
the bosOn of higgs in detail 
the announcement of likely discovery of bosOn of higgs equal a great shock the summer last , and with reason . 
is believes , in effect , that this bosOn is involve of mechanism responsible of the mass of all what that there in the universe , nothing more and nothing least . 
and what that is more , is is of the partIcula whose existence unusual the model standard : our better or &apos; least bad &apos; explanation of the nature and of behaviour of the on , that still not has been seen economically . 
but for the physical not is completely clear that is involved of higgs . 
know without place to doubt that there a new partIcula and that is seems much to bosOn of higgs predicted by the model standard . 
also , new data desvelados this week in a important congress of physical fact in kyoto seem confirm that yes what is , although still and more data for be completely insurance . 
of all ways , assume that is is of higgs , already that the possibilities of get seem few . will of what is is . 
there , in this great world , a law widespread and absolutely that means that two things not can found in the same place to same time . 
not there way of broad that rule and not what trying too , because will gaining damage . 
although the physical of the particles be a world very complex , is has shown that also in she there a law of these characteristics : the principle of exclusion of pauli , that stipulates that two particles not can should the same space to same time if are in the same &apos; state cuAntico &apos; ; a &apos; state &apos; that certain , achieve way , of some of their characteristics . 
the physical classify the particles in two categories . 
by a part we are with the good citizens called fermiones , that supporting wisely to principle of pauli . 
and by other are the bosones , a dosage buffoons of anarquistas that not has respect by nothing , or to least not by this principle , what that means that can found in the same place and to same time . 
according the indeed website the particle adventure of the laboratories berkeley that , by true , is extraordinary , the bosones is into in two groups : the breweries , of the that not we here , and the &apos; particles of force &apos; , by the that the large forces of the nature is epidemic and with the which the bosOn of higgs would of any way emparentado . 
these bosones , be stress here , not are the bichos exOticos that could believe . 
of fact , if there read this risk , is thank to a bosOn extremely trivial : the fotOn or the &apos; partIcula of light &apos; that acts as &apos; bringing &apos; of the force electromagnetic . 
in effect , when a partIcula with a burden we accelerates or time of direction , &apos; desordena &apos; the field electromagnEtico in that be environment ; a little as when we a stone to a dig . 
in this &apos; point &apos; stems a wavelength electromagnetic ( of the light , of the infrared , of the appalling , etc ) , and this wavelength not is other thing that a fotOn ; is say , one of the bosones &apos; carriers of force &apos; . 
field more stable 
happens what same with the bosOn of higgs , with the difference of that is is of another field , the field of higgs , that needs be &apos; desordenado &apos; for that this bosOn hang . 
now well , the field of higgs is great more stable that the field electromagnEtico . for activarlo ago lack come to energy extremely do , a little as if is like of a dig came in the that so only a rock gruesa could avoid by the surface . 
by this ago lack a in put of particles as the of the cern ( the great colisionador of hadrones is a ring of 27 km of 314 ! ) for achieve such levels of energy . 
the analogy with the field electromagnEtico is a new tool that explains the relationship between the higgs and the mass . 
of fact , not all the particles or all the materials blundell with the field electromagnEtico . 
some , as the eradicate , what do , but other not : a paper of role , by example , not is will never by yes same grass-roots to the door of a begin . 
and of the same way , not all the particles blundell with the field of higgs : the that what do have a mass , while that the rest ( how the fotOn , by true ) , not the have . 
now well , what &apos; can they &apos; all these research ? , question the madam plamondon . 
for the science , this serves for verify the validity of model standard ( ms ) , and allows , also , that the physical escrutinen the differences between the comments and the predictions of ms . 
by their part , many want desire that is who , therefore the less difference could open a door to a &apos; new physical &apos; that tape certain holes of model . 
this , there that say , has still enormous shortcomings , as that not proposes explanation any on to the serious ( ups ! ) or to the on brown-skinned , that constitutes around of 80 % of the on of universe ( another ups ! ) . 
but not we found such differences in the cern to the time . 
impact 
the impact of these research in our day to day are difficult of predict , but not we that we let to say that not will no . 
for that just : to at of the years 60 , the pioneers of infrared in the laboratories not sospechaban in all the revolution that their jobs provocarIan . 
entreveIan the applications scientific , but nothing more . 
of fact , as already said the physical willard boyle , that worked in the laboratories bell , where is invented the infrared in 1960 , and that booklet the first infrared beside ( the first were pulsados ) in 1962 , to principle the infrared was more well considered a &apos; course of laboratory &apos; . 
imagine ... 
and also , the applications can also proceed of all the implementing that are to the research . 
by example , the same willard boyle booklet a captador of light in 1969 in the course of their research in on of angles . 
to despite of that not was in all their intention original , this captador serves now of &apos; eye &apos; for all the equipment digital of world , what that you apocalyptic the nobel of physical in 2009 . 
that not want say , by course , that the activities of lhc want necessarily into our lives , but that never is know ... 
care palliative . the better way of die ... &#124; you devoir 
in their commission die in dignity , quebec indian recently the sensitive question of end of the life . 
the debate must joined soon while is indication a project of law . 
now well , within of that dominance essential , still there much that do . 
you devoir has tried see of close . 
ago hardly a weeks , the mr l. living only in their flat of the montErEgie . 
the cancer of prostate that you was destroying you had given a four-year of two years . 
&apos; i had given five years of life , but already i so seven &apos; , mark , fact a is , tumbado in their bed in the centre of care palliative victor-gadbois of beloeil , to the that was the day previous . 
&apos; but always is a shock , not we be prepared for this &apos; , continues . 
the disease you has caused havoc : a weakness huge that you from go only to bathing and even feed by yes only . 
at with to a apetitoso lunch , will mood that you help to feed . 
purposeful , comes even to he , to about with the unknown that you play attention , you bring medicines and you offered a bathing . 
the courage of the death ordinary . 
&apos; my greater i is that i curen the diarrhoeal , is humiliating &apos; , admits . 
a hours more later , the team found no to that bad . 
&apos; in the course of our lives projects that a man ago pis of ordinary &apos; , mark pierre brodeur , fariNas in the centre victor-gadbois . 
return to their childhood , for certain people , is a humiliation unacceptable . 
&apos; that on of the capacity of the person for accept that regression &apos; , complaints . 
because , according the opinion of the majority of the people that working in care palliative , the large at have place in the heart same of that regression . 
all the patients that entering in the centre of care palliative victor-gadbois from cancer . 
have a prognosis of life maximum of three months . 
in that state , the team of doctors and nurses that them around already not offered the care &apos; curative &apos; . 
the greater fear of the mrs by , of 89 years , is die &apos; aware and ahogada &apos; . 
but the disease you has fact be to their children . 
&apos; i a good children &apos; , adds . 
&apos; already not i are more wishes in this life &apos; , says , before of accept that is you long a mascarilla for her to breathe . 
and expected , in the next days , a last visit of their son that live in italy . 
in victor-gadbois is offers , with a group of voluntary , the care of body and aid to the food . 
are care palliative that is them give when not is can do nothing more . 
for help to that their death be more confortable .
